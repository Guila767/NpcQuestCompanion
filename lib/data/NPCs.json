    "mainContent": "**Merchant Kalé** is a `Merchant` and `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. **Merchant Kalé** can be found in `Limgrave`: `Church of Elleh`, soon after emerging from the Stranded Graveyard at the start of the game, you’ll see a building to the North which is the Church of Elleh.\r\n \r\n### Merchant Kalé Location in Elden Ring\r\nFound within the structure of the `Church of Elleh` in `Limgrave`. This is north from the first Site of Grace the player encounters after exiting the `Fringefolk Hero's Grave` underground dwelling. [`Map Link`]\r\n- This merchant does not move\r\n- This merchant can be fought\r\n- If defeated, drops:  \n  \t- 500 `Runes` \r\n\t- \"Finger Snap\" `Gesture`\r\n\t- `Kalé's Bell Bearing`\r\n \r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Merchant Kalé Shop\r\n \r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Merchant Kalé\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *You are a Tarnished, I can see it. And I can also see... That you're not after my throat. Then why not purchase a little something? I am Kale, Purveyor of fine goods.*\r\nAbout Kale\r\n- *I am of a nomadic people. Selling wares as I travel. The land has been tainted by madness since the shattering of the Elden Ring. It's only Tarnished like yourself who keep things from drying up entirely. Let's say you're a very welcome customer.*\r\nRecommendation\r\n- *You know, if you can spare the runes, you should buy yourself a crafting kit. A crafting kit allows you to make basic items on your own. Essential really, if you intend to survive out here for any duration. The kit costs a bundle, and I admit, I do take my cut. But the important thing is that you survive. Every customer counts, after all.*\r\n- *I'm glady you took my warning to heart. You've made an excellent choice. (after you buy the recommendation)*\r\nSmall Talk\r\n- *There are other of my peoples who yet survive in these lands. If the mood takes you when you meet one, then offer them some trade, won't you? My people, wanderers all, have long been spurned by the grace of gold. Which is why we cannot settle, but instead are forced into this pitiful, unceasing journey. But thanks to that, things are not so different for us now, though the Elden Ring is shattered. I think this makes us kindred spirits of sorts Your people, the Tarnished, and mine.*\r\n- *Perhaps you don't need to hear this, but... See that no harm comes to my kin. We have a saying, we wanderers. Lament not your solitude. Expect no sympathy. No regard. Nothing. But if anyone dares harm us, show them no mercy. That is our code, so to speak. Just the way we are. Deeply... unforgiving.*\r\nHowling in the Mistwood\r\n- *\"The howl of a wolf, in the Mistwood...I suppose he must still be skulking about...Mmm, I know. Why not meet him for yourself? Next time you hear the wolf's howl, make this signal right under the source. Oh, don't fret, there is nothing to fear. I just have an inkling the two of you might hit it off. \"*\r\nAbout Blaidd\r\n- *\"Oh, then you met Blaidd, did you? Wonderful. I'm glad I pointed you in his direction. He's boorish, blunt, and couldn't find his nose with both hands, but he's a good egg. I think the two of you are sure to find the best in one another.\"*\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- *I knew you for a highwayman all along. Then it's time you learnt a lesson. Our people will not stand for your barbarism!*\r\n- (On player kill)* Is that all you were, mate?*\r\nWhen Killed\r\n- *Is this... how it ends? I'll never find...*\r\nOther\r\n- *Wait, weren't you? Well, you're back... Care to buy something?*\r\n- *What is it? Still going to purchase something?*\r\n- *Good-bye, for now.*\r\n- *Goody-bye. Nice to do bussiness.*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Notes & Trivia for Merchant Kalé\r\n- Upon travelling to the Mistwood Ruins and hearing a wolf's howl, Kalé get's a new dialogue option that unlocks the \"Finger Snap\" gesture, providing it without the need to kill him.\r\n- Merchant Kalé was also a part of the Closed Network Test.\r\n \r\n"

    "mainContent": "**Sorceress Sellen** is a `Merchant` and `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. She can be found inside the `Waypoint Ruins`, far east from where you first arrive in Limgrave. She can teach you `Sorceries`. She can also be made available as an `NPC Summon` for specific boss battles.\r\n \r\n### Sorceress Sellen Location in Elden Ring\r\n- She is found standing near a treasure chest within the `Waypoint Ruins` in the central-east part of `Limgrave`. Players can reach her after defeating the boss of the area `Mad Pumpkin Head`. After defeating the boss, the Site of Grace \"Waypoint Ruins Cellar\" appears in their boss room, allowing easy access to Sellen's services. `Map Link` for Waypoint Ruins.\r\n- **Sorceress Sellen** can also be found kept prisoner at `Witchbane Ruins`, however, other than speaking to her, nothing can be done with her here until progressing far enough into her quest line. Be warned, attacking Sellen here can cause issues with her availability as a merchant elsewhere and stall progression in her quest line. This can possibly be resolved by seeking absolution at the Church of Vows. `Map Link` for Witchbane Ruins.\r\n- She can be summoned to aid in the `Red Wolf of Radagon` boss fight, after progressing her quest line to the point that she leaves for `Raya Lucaria Academy`.\r\n- Once the player has progressed her quest line far enough, two new summon signs will appear at the entrance to the Raya Lucaria Grand Library, offering the player a choice between assisting her (gold sign) or challenging her (red sign).\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Sorceress Sellen Shop\r\n You can choose among the following options while talking to **Sorceress Sellen**:\r\n- Study sorcery: Learn a sorcery from Sellen in exchange for Runes.\r\n- Give a scroll: Give Sellen a sorcery scroll key item to add the sorceries contained within it to Sellen's merchant inventory.\r\n- Give letter of introduction: After receiving the Letter of Introduction from `Preceptor Seluvis`, you can then speak with Sellen about it. She will inform you that `General Radahn` must be defeated in order to restore the movement of the stars, which will reveal a way to access the lost city of Nokron.\r\n \r\n### Sorceress Sellen Questline: How to complete Sorceress Sellen's Quest\r\n- Sellen can first be encountered at the `Waypoint Ruins`, after defeating the boss guarding her room. She will introduce herself as the Graven Witch. Should you accept her offer to study sorceries under her, you will be able to pursue her quest line. Learning enough sorceries from her will unlock more dialogue with her.\r\n- North of `Hermit Village` on Mt. Gelmir, you can find the sorcerer `Azur`, who will give you the sorcery `Comet Azur` upon interacting with him. Afterwards, go back and speak with Sellen to continue to the next part of her quest line.\r\n- Note: Holding off on completing the following step will not prevent Sellen's quest line from continuing until much later. Sellen will ask you to find another sorcerer, `Master Lusat`, who is locked away behind a special magic seal deep inside `Sellia Hideaway` in Caelid. She will give you an item that will allow you to break the seal that holds him. Upon interacting with Master Lusat, he will gift you with the sorcery Stars of Ruin. Return to Sellen and she will reward you with a Starlight Shard. You can locate the pit leading to the magic seal Master Lusat is trapped behind by finding a crystal snail on a ledge above a crystal cluster and a crystal you can walk down, pictured below.\r\n``  \r\n- Return to Sellen after defeating `Starscourge Radahn`. She will request that you meet her in person at the `Witchbane Ruins` where she will give you `Sellen's Primal Glintstone`.\r\n- If you haven't done so yet, travel back to `Redmane Castle` where `Witch-Hunter Jerren` can be found sitting in the throne room. Speak with him and exhaust his dialogue. Afterwards, reset the area by resting at any Site of Grace. This should cause Castle Redmane to return to the enemy filled state it was in before the Radahn Festival event began.\r\n- Return to `Witchbane Ruins` where you will find Jerren standing in the room with a now deceased Sellen. Once again, speak with Jerren and exhaust his dialogue.\r\n- Journey to the `Three Sisters` area and locate the ruins on the right side of the approach up to Ranni's Rise. You must locate an illusory floor tht must be struck to reveal. The location of the illusory floor is shown below.\r\n``  \r\n- Within this secret basement of dolls, there is an illusory wall beside the glowing message that says \"Seluvis's puppet. Do not touch.\" On the other side of the illusory wall is a room containing a doll duplicate of Sellen, where you can insert the Primal Glintstone by interacting with it. After speaking with the now revived Sellen, she will resume selling sorceries at this location until Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon is defeated.\r\n- After completing the previous steps and defeating Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, fast travel to the Raya Lucaria Grand Library Site of Grace. Right outside the entrance should be two summon signs.\t- The gold summon sign offers the option to assist Sellen, where you will need to aid her in fighting Witch Hunter Jerren: \n    \t\t- Defeating Jerren will reward you with the `Eccentric Set`.\r\n\t\t- After the fight, you can find Sellen standing inside the Grand Library where Renalla once was, with Renalla sadly sitting off to the side of the room. Speak with Sellen and exhaust her dialogue to receive the `Glintstone Kris` and have the sorcery `Shard Spiral` added to Sellen's merchant inventory.\r\n\t\t- Sellen will remain where she stands in the Grand Library until you have completed the part of her quest line to find Master Lusat. Once that part of her quest line has been completed, reset the area. You will find that Sellen will have moved to the side of the room and transformed into a School of Graven Mages (beside of which can be found her Witch's Glintstone Crown) and Rennala will have returned to her original position in the center of the room. Despite Sellen's \"condition\", you can still purchase sorceries from her at any time by speaking with her.\r\n\t\t- After Sellen's transformation, you can revisit the spots where you first encountered Master Azur and Master Lusat to find their armor sets (`Azur's Glintstone Set` and `Lusat's set`, respectively) laying on the ground where they once were. \r\n \r\n\t- The red summon sign offers the option to challenge Sellen, where you will need to aid Witch Hunter Jerren in defeating Sellen: \n    \t\t- Defeating Sellen will reward you with the `Witch's Glintstone Crown` and `Sellen's Bell Bearing`.\r\n\t\t- Jerren will can be found afterwards, standing just outside the entrance to the Grand Library.\r\n\t\t- Speak to Jerren and he will reward you with an `Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone`.\r\n\t\t- At this point, Jerren can still be killed in order to obtain the his armor set, the Eccentric Set.\r\n\t\t- If you choose this option and kill Sellen, you will not be able to get the `Lusat Set` and `Azur Set` until your next game cycle.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Sorceress Sellen\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Tarnished, are we? A wonder you should turn up here.**I am Sellen, a sorcerer, quite plainly. Why are you here?*\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- *What's the meaning of this? How unfortunate. <disappears>*\r\n- *You sadden me, my apprentice.*\r\n- (On player kill)* For a time, I believed us kindred spirits. My apprentice...*\r\nAfter you say you want to learn sorcery\r\n- *Ahh, a yen for glintstone sorceries? Well, your aptitude does appear...passable. But one must choose one's masters wisely.**I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria, as a reviled, apostate witch. Do you still wish to learn from me?*\r\nI still want to learn\r\n- *Well, you are a piece of work. Very well. You are now my protégé in glintstone sorcery. But I refuse to coddle. Or cast kind words. Never.**Anticipate grievances, young apprentice.*\r\nVisit\r\n- *Young apprentice, first things first. You are a tadpole when it comes to magic. Infantile. Without the legs to walk.So, to become a sorcerer, first, you must face your ignorance. Now, shall we start learning?*\r\nAfter buying some sorceries\r\n- *Our powers draw upon the powers embedded in glintstone, but what is the nature of such power? Glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, golden amber contains the remnants of ancient life and houses its vitality, while Glintstone contains residual life. And thus, the vitality of the stars. It should not be forgotten that glintstone sorcery is the study of the stars and the life therin.*\r\nGiving her the Royal House Scroll\r\n- *Oh, is that a scroll? Takes me back to my academy days. Very well. This is sorcery with which I'm not entirely unfamiliar. I'll be sure to incorporate it into one of your lessons. Never lose that inquisitive spirit, my apprentice.*\r\nWhile imprisoned at Witchbane Ruins\r\n- *It will do no good, I swear it...and yet you persist, you frothing degenerates...A...argh!*\r\nShow Seluvis's Letter of Introduction to Sellen\r\n- *Well, well... Seluvis is not a name I ever wanted to hear again... But, fine. If it will help you, my apprentice, I offer my knowledge. The stars alter the fate of the Carian royal family. And the fate of your mistress, Ranni. But long ago, General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations, and in a crushing victory, arrested their cycles. Now, he is the force that repulses the stars. If General Radahn were to die, the stars would resume their movement. And so, too, would Ranni's destiny.*\r\nShow Azur's sorcery\r\n- *Ah, then you have seen Master Azur. Master Azur was a founding glintstone sorcerer, and my first teacher. A stern judge of men, but he must have seen something in you. You make us both proud. We can speak more later, my apprentice.*\r\nTell me your story\r\n- *If you recall, I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria. It was for attempting to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. The toothless pedantry peddled by the Carian royal family can rot for all I care. I want glintstone sorceries that open our minds, unbound by terrestrial taboos. No matter what we give in return. My apprentice. I presume nothing. Teacher and student are not bound to tread the same path. But hear me out, my apprentice. I need your help to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. Perhaps this is a journey we could take together?*\r\n- (Let's journey together) *Splendid. I thank you. This pleases me. It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit. You must have a fabulous teacher.*\r\nI have a favour to ask\r\n- *I need your help, my apprentice. Master Lusat is another founding glintstone sorcerer. And like Master Azur, he was banished from the academy. Now he languishes, imprisoned somewhere. My apprentice, can you find Master Lusat? With this glintstone key, you should be able to cross the boundary that encloses him.*\r\n- *I need him to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. He's nigh a child of the stars, such is his body now...*\r\nLead on Lusat\r\n- *After his expulsion from the academy, I heard that Master Lusat returned to his home. A place called Sellia, in the eastern Caelid Wilds. Thinking about it, I obtained the glintstone key I gave you from a Sellian sorcerer. It wouldn't be too much of a leap to suppose he's still cooped up nearby.*\r\nAfter meeting Master Lusat\r\n- *My apprentice. Give me a moment later. I have a favour to ask.*\r\n- *Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat...You have my gratitude. This is all your work. I am truly pleased to have you as an apprentice, and a kindred spirit. This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it.*\r\n- *This brings us a full step closer. The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the academy. If only I could undo these wretched shackles...*\r\nAbout the request\r\n- *The form you see before you is merely a projection. My body lies elsewhere. But the academy's shackles prevent it being moved. My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between, imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum. Can you make the journey to my body? I have something that I can only trust with you. *\r\nAt Witchbane Ruins (after hearing about her request)\r\n- *My apprentice, thank you for coming. These shackles take a toll on us all. There is something I need you to look after. My primal glintstone. A star has fallen, and my fortunes waver. someone may come for my life. And so, I entrust it with you. My self.*\r\n- *Thank you...my apprentice... This...is my essence. Please, treat it with care.*\r\n- *Treat it with care, my apprentice... What you hold is my very being...*\r\nUsing Sellen's Primal Glintstone in the secret room at the Three Sisters\r\n- *My apprentice, just how long has it been? Thank you. You've helped me fill a new body, once again. And it's truly a gem. Young and full of vigor, a snug fit for my Primal Glintstone. Better still, I've shed those awful shackles. Finally, I can return to the academy. To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current. My dear apprentice, I owe this all to you.*\r\nChallenging Jerren\r\n- *Jerren, bringer of my death.You have my gratitude. For freeing me from my shackles.But I am afraid your work is done.Join the school. To reflect on your mistake.*\r\n After defeating Jerren\r\n- *Ahh, my apprentice.You've saved my skin once again.**Do you see this? The Queen of Caria is no more.**With the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat returned, the academy can hone the primeval current.**So that we, fallen children of the stars, shall beam with brilliance once again.**My apprentice. Will you stay with us, here at the academy?**Oh, I know it's not possible.**You have your own calling. To be the next Elden Lord.**But do think of me.**Of your teacher. On the eve of your crowning.**You will always be my darling pupil.**Rest assured that I...**No, the entire academy, will swear allegiance to the new monarch.**My apprentice. Become Elden Lord.*\r\n- *Hmm. Perhaps I'm jumping ahead,**but here is a symbol of my allegiance, and the academy's.**(gives `Glintstone Kris`)**Do you recall what I once told you?**That glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, and sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein.**When you become Elden Lord, please illuminate me.**Lay bare the secrets of life which course the Elden Ring.**Next time, I will be your student.*\r\n- *Oh, one last thing.**If you fail to claim your throne,you can always pay me a visit.Oh, don't fret. Even my dullest pupils will always have a place here.*\r\nAfter reloading the area\r\n- *U...urgh. M-my...apprentice...I-I'm...*\r\nOther\r\n- *There you are, my apprentice. Shall we commence the lesson?*\r\n- *All done? Well, be on your way then.*\r\n- *You wish to continue the lesson? Very well, I have time aplenty.*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Notes & Trivia for Sorceress Sellen\r\n- You can give Sellen the `Royal House Scroll` to add the sorceries `Glintblade Phalanx` and `Carian Slicer` to her merchant inventory.\r\n- You can give Sellen the `Academy Scroll` to add the sorceries `Great Glintstone Shard` and `Swift Glintstone Shard` to her merchant inventory.\r\n- You can give Sellen the `Conspectus Scroll` to add the sorceries `Glintstone Cometshard` and `Star Shower` to her merchant inventory.\r\n- In combat, Sellen wields a `Carian Glintstone Staff` and can cast `Crystal Release`, `Shattering Crystal`, `Founding Rain of Stars`, and `Glintstone Cometshard.`\r\n- Completing Sorceress Sellen's questline will affect the boss fight with `Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing`,  preventing him from casting `Comet Azur`.\r\n###  Sorceress Sellen Image Gallery\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n"

I'll be more careful, too.\"*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhen asked about Roderika\r\n- *\"The girl you brought here... **She's crestfallen, and can scarcely swing a blade, but she has a gift for spirit tuning.**I saw another one like her, long ago. Their eyes share the same hue\".*\r\nAfter speaking to Roderika\r\n- *\"The girl? What about her?\"*\t-   \n    \t\t- *\"Are you out of your mind?**Who'd stay with an ugly brute who only knows how to smith?**Absurd. And besides, she'd never agree to it\".*\r\n \r\n\t- \t\t- *\"I refuse to believe it. I don't doubt you,**but I know when something's too good to be true\".*\r\n \r\n \r\n*After speaking to Roderika again*\r\n- *I spoke with the girl. She has a gift for spirit tuning. So I told her everything I know. I'm indebted to a spirit tuner I met long ago. It was all I could do to honour her.I'm sorry I doubted you.*\r\nOther\r\n- After defeating Godrick, The Grafted \n  \t- *\"Now, look at you. Those eyes tell a story. Of a challenger, who's felled her mark.Fine and well. Now, lay out your arms\".*\r\n \r\n- Interaction while smithing\t- *\"Well, where've you been hiding? **I took you for dead.**No matter. It's all the same. **Lay out your arms, then\".*\r\n \r\n- After defeating Godskin Duo \n  \t- *\"I'll smith... as long as you like\"** \"Now ...lay out your ...arms\"*\r\n \r\n- After picking up the Sanctified Whetblade from Fortified Manor\t- *\"No, no, no, no...**I need to do better than this! This'll never kill a god.**I can do better than this! It needs to slay a bloody god!**Oh, it's you.**Don't pay me any mind. It's not important.**Just lay out your arms.\"*\r\n \r\n*About Roderika (after her dialogue about becoming a certified spirit tuner)*\r\n- *The girl has come a long way.As ever, time and technique have made her stronger. Tis good to see.An imprisoned monster does not deserve an apprentice, or a daughter.But at times, that's precisely what she feels like to me.I've gone soft. And it isn't easy.*\r\nAfter refusing Melina's request at the Forge of the Giants\r\n- *Are you having second thoughts? Might I have a word, then?Your kind are meant to challenge them. To slay them.The demigods. And their god.If you remain loyal to your calling, then no matter what you do, no matter what happens to me,I will never cease to smith your weapons. Until you have one to slay a god.*\r\nAfter the cutscene at the Forge of the Giants\r\n- *I knew you'd be back. Lay out your arms. Let's get to smithing.*\r\n- *Weren't you listening? As I've always said. You came to challenge the demigods, and their god. To slay them.And as long as you do, I will always smith your weapons.It is what I wish. To smith a weapon for you to slay a god.*\r\nAfter speaking to Roderika again\r\n- *I've upset the girl. She says that now my chains are broken, I'm free. That if I stay here, I will be ruined with the Roundtable.What use have I for freedom now? I smith weapons to slay a god. I have lived, and will die, doing so, upon this spot.Is there any other way?*\r\nAbout the god-slaying weapon\r\n- *Use my masterpiece to slay a god. That is all that I have lived for.And my promise to Q-queen Marika. But do me a favor, and do look after the girl.*\r\n- *I can't hold on much longer. I'm going the way of the R-roundtable... It was a great honor to smith your weapons during my time here.Allow me to c-call you this, just once, before it ends. My lord, f-for that is what you are.*\r\nAfter completing Crumbling Farum Azula\r\n- *Who are you? Oh, I must be a blacksmith. Now, let's get smithing...*\r\n- *Could you tell me what happened? Why is the Roundtable burning, in ruins?Why does that girl weep for me?* *Have I forgotten something of dire importance?*\r\n### Elden Ring Smithing Master Hewg Notes & Trivia\r\n- Notes and tips about this character go here.\r\n \r\n## Smithing Master Hewg Image Gallery\r\n\r\n \r\n"

    "mainContent": "**Roderika** is an `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. **Roderika** is a spirit-tuner that you will encounter at `Stormhill Shack` on the trail to Stormveil. She will later move to the `Roundtable Hold` if you progress her quest.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Roderika Location in Elden Ring\r\n**Roderika** can be found in multiple locations:\r\n1. Roderika is first found at `Stormhill Shack` [`Map Link`] as an `NPC` called Heartbroken Maiden, and she gives you the Spirit Jellyfish Ashes.\r\n1. Moves to `Roundtable Hold` after giving her the `Chrysalids' Memento` OR resting at any site of grace in the `Liurnia of the Lakes` region. The earliest possible trigger for acquiring Roderika's `Golden Seed` is resting at the `Lake-Facing Cliffs` grace. \r\n- This merchant can't be fought\r\n \r\n### RODERIKA QUESTLINE: HOW TO COMPLETE RODERIKA'S QUEST\r\n- If you talk several times to Roderika while she is found on `Stormhill Shack`, you will obtain `Sitting Sideways` pose and then she will give you the `Spirit Jellyfish Ashes`.\r\n- Deliver her message and return with a `Chrystalids' Memento` found on a pile of corpses within Rampart Tower. She will still be at the shack. The next time you meet Roderika will be at the `Roundtable Hold`. Meet her there to obtain a `Golden Seed`.\r\n- She can be found later again in `Roundtable Hold` as a Spirit Tuner where she is not wearing her riding hood anymore, provided that you have given her the `Chrysalids' Memento` and have spoken to `Smithing Master Hewg`. \n  \t- **If you missed Roderika at the `Stormhill Shack`, **when she appears at the `Roundtable Hold`, chose the \"About Roderika\" option from Smithing Master Hewg's dialogue options and continue the quest as normal.\r\n\t- **If you go around Margit and acquire the Lake-Facing Cliffs Grace early, it will auto complete the quest up to this point early and not require you to go get the `Chrysalids' Memento`.  This may be a bug.**\r\n \r\n- Initially, you'll find Roderika standing next to the fireplace when she moves to the `Roundtable Hold`. Make sure to speak to her and exhaust her dialogues to acquire x1 `Golden Seed` as a reward for giving her the memento. \n  \t- If you did not give her the Chrysalids' Memento prior to her appearing at Roundtable Hold, you can still aquire the Golden Seed by visiting Stormhill Shack and looting it from where she once laid.\r\n \r\n- For Roderika to become an apprentice Spirit Tuner, you must speak to `Smithing Master Hewg` about Roderika, tell Roderika about what Hewg mentioned, and convince Hewg again that Roderika wishes to learn more about her gift. \n  \t- **If you missed Roderika at the Stormhill Shack, **choose the \"Please\" dialogue option to receive the `Spirit Jellyfish Ashes`.\r\n \r\n- After doing so, leave the hub, return her at any given time, and you can find Roderika in the same room where `Smithing Master Hewg` is, on the left side, sitting on the floor.\r\n- Moving forward, if you speak to her, **Roderika** can now upgrade your `Spirit Ashes` with the skill of Spirit Tuning, provided you have the required Runes and `Glovewort Items`.\r\n- The `Crimson Hood` that she wore can can be obtained where you found the `Chrysalids' Memento` if you return to that location after completing the Questline.\r\n- After you burn the erdtree, she moves to the fire place in the round table. She asks you to speak to smithing Master Hewg and try to convince him to leave the roundtable.\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Roderika\r\n Talk to her several times when you find her at `Stormhill Shack` until she gives you the `Spirit Jellyfish Ashes`.\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *\"Everyone's...been grafted. **Everyone who came with me.They crossed the sea for me. They fought, for me.**Heh... **Only to have their arms taken. Their legs taken.Even their heads...taken. **Taken and stuck to the spider.**Did you know? If you're grafted by the spider, you become a chrysalid.**It's quite the lark, when you think about it.\"*\r\nWhen visiting at Stormhill Shack\r\n- *\"You're all on your own, are you? **And heading to Stormveil Castle?**Enticed by the one in the white mask, I suppose.Oh, you've come to be one with the spider?**Well, that makes us two peas in a pod. **But I don't have your courage.**It's scary, you know. Having your arms cut off. Or legs. Or your head.**I want to be like everyone else, but I'm just too scared.**I'm nothing but a craven.\"*\r\n- *\"It was a pleasure to see you.**Oh, can you pass on a message for me, if you see the little chrysalids in Stormveil Castle?**Tell them I love them. And that, despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough.**I'm finally getting the hang of this whole \"pain\" thing, you know.\"*\r\n- *\"Oh, I know. Can you take this little one along with you?\"**\"The poor thing deserves someone braver than myself...And the spirits look rather fondly upon you.It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un\".*\r\n- *\"A pleasure to see you.Did you give the little chrysalids the message?That I love them. And that, despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough\".*\r\nUpon receiving Chrysalids' Memento\r\n- *\"What's this? A keepsake? From my men?**Oh, goodness me... I can't... They all...believed in me.**They all thought I'd make something of myself. Me! Who can't do anything...**I think I'll head to the Roundtable Hold. Perhaps I'll find my purpose there\".*\r\nUpon attacking / rolling / jumping\r\n- *\"You're willing to make me a chrysalid? Ah, but I'm still a milksop craven... I can't even govern myself to step beyond the bounds of this ward. Please. You're only wasting your strength.\"*\r\n- *\"I know you you must feel. But please, I'm not ready. Or are you like me? You're so far out of your mind with fear? You've divested yourself of all reason?\"*\r\n- *\"Please stop. Even if you persist, your fear will not abate.\"*\r\nAt Roundtable Hold\r\n- *\"Greetings. Nice to see you again.**My name is Roderika. I should have told you sooner. **Isn't this place impressive, though?**The Roundtable Hold, covert quarters of the Two Fingers, and gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord.**I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots.**Although, it's all a bit much for me, in truth. **I'm still looking for my own purpose\"*.\r\n- *\"Oh, and... Please, allow to me to express my thanks. For giving me that keepsake from my men.**It was as if I was frozen with self-pity. I failed them at every turn. You have my gratitude.**Please, take this\"*.\r\n- *It's all a bit much for me, in truth.**I'm still looking for my own purpose.*\r\nAfter asking Smithing Master Hewg about her\r\n- *\"A pleasure to see you. Thank goodness you're safe. I'm still looking for my own purpose.It's not easy, by any means, but it's what I must do.\"*\r\n- (Tell her what the blacksmith said)* \"You're telling me I possess some kind of gift? I don't believe you. But...**If I do have this talent, and goodness knows it would be my first...**I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I? I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me.**Certainly, he does appear intimidating, and holds no love for us Tarnished...**But I know he's trapped here, at the Roundtable Hold... So...**I can tell. He's a gentle soul, underneath it all\".*\r\n- *\"If I do have a talent for spirit tuning, and goodness knows that would be a surprise...**I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I? I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me\".*\r\nNext visit after asking Smithing Master Hewg to take care of her\r\n- *\"Good to see you again. Thank you very much!**I have you to thank, don't I? For persuading Master Hewg?**I can happily announce that he has taught me the noble toil of spirit tuning.**I'm as yet unsure of what I might be able to accomplish, but if I might be any help to you all, I'd certainly like to try.**And if there's an chance to ease the suffering of my dear men who were grafted..**Well, I certainly must try.**Roderika the spirit tuner prentice. Pleased to make your acquaintance\".*\r\nAfter a certain amount of Spirit Tuning\r\n- *\"I feel like I'm really coming to grips with spirit tuning of late.**I can understand their yearnings, what they become drawn to...**Master Hewg said it himself, actually, that I'm no mere prentice any longer**Once again, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. Roderika the certified spirit tuner\".*\r\nWhen visiting at Roundtable Hold\r\n- *\"Greetings. **Are you here for spirit tuning?\"*\r\nAfter burning the Erdtree\r\n- *\"Take a look around. The Roundtable Hold is burned. Razed to the ground.**Don't worry, I don't blame you. I'll continue sprit tuning just the same as before.**Which is why I need your help persuading Master Hewg to leave.**His roots are so knotted in this place. He won't last much longer if he stays here...**His shackles are broken. He's a free man, now. **It's high time he put the Roundtable behind him\"*\r\nNext visit after speaking to Smithing Master Hewg\r\n- *\"So Master Hewg won't listen to you, either.**You have my thanks, regardless.I'll try and talk him round next time.**I know he was given this great entreaty; to craft a weapon which could slay a god.**Though I can't help but think of it as a curse. A fearsome curse, put on him by Queen Marika.**And if that's the case, I'm not sure there's anything we can do\"*\r\nAfter completing Crumbling Farum Azula and speaking to Hewg\r\n- *\"Ah. So it wasn't just me this happened to... To think he'd forget who you were, as well.I knew he'd burn himself out, old Hewg.I think we could talk him into leaving the Roundtable Hold, now.But maybe it's better that we don't. It's only proper that we respect his choice to stay.\"*\r\n- *\"I'll remain with Hewg. He made me who I am today.I'd like to return the kindness, in whatever small way I can.\"*\r\n- *\"Please, become Elden Lord. Hewg was always saying that you were a Lord, to him.So slay her, with the weapons he smithed. Slay the god, Marika, who cursed us all.\"*\r\nThere's something you should know (the first time Dung Eater visits the Roundtable Hold)\r\n- *\"A little while ago someone started lurking in the wing on the opposite side of the roundtable.And I can hear, from all the way over there... The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of a curse. I can ever hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself... A plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony...I can't even imagine. How much suffering, inflicted to who knows how many souls...You should keep your distance, I know you're strong, but please.\"*\r\nAbout the spirits' voices (after Dung Eater leaves the Roundtable Hold)\r\n- *\"I suppose the Dung Eater must have left the Roundtable.I just pray nothing ill comes of this.\"*\r\nPlease take care (when Dung eater comes back to the Roundtable Hold)\r\n- *\"He's back. The Dung Eater. Again.**I can hear them; the spirits as they howl and lament in fear of the curse.**And worse than ever, the reverberation of the twisted malison itself.But after all this time, I've started to grasp it now.**I can hear, in the malison, another fearsome Order.\"*\r\nAbout the spirits' voices (after Dung Eater's quest ends and he leaves the Roundtable Hold for a second time)\r\n- *\"But it isn't like last time.**I'm almost certain...the spirits have escaped their confinement.**Did you...have anything to do with it, I wonder?\"*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Roderika Notes & Trivia\r\n- Even if you miss the Chrysalids' Memento, it's still possible to fully complete her questline without drawbacks. Simply proceed with the rest of the questline as normal. If she's not available in Roundtable Hold, simply check back at Stormveil Shack every once in a while and see if she's still there or not. If she's no longer there, then you can push forward her questline regardless of the Chrysalids' Memento.\r\n- Once you've leveled up an unknown amount of spirit ashes, she proclaims that she is no longer an apprentice, and gives you the curtsy gesture.\r\n- A golden barrier is protecting her at her first location if rolling, jumping or attacking (near) her.\r\n### Roderika Image Gallery \r\n\r\n \r\n"

    "mainContent": "**Enia** or **Finger Reader Enia** is an `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. **Enia** is an ancient woman, wielding a massive club. She is known as the *Finger Reader*. **Enia **can help the player draw out the power that lies within a remembrance of a God. Enia is different from the nameless `Finger Readers` that you meet in different areas, Enia seems to know you, but for the Finger Readers, their interests pique as they try to read what is written on your fingers. Enia also serves as a direct interpreter of the Fingers, envoys to the Greater Will.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Enia Location in Elden Ring\r\nEnia can be found at `Roundtable Hold` as a merchant. She will be in the room with the Two Fingers, which can be accessed after defeating a Shardbearer.\r\n- This NPC does not move. \r\n- This merchant can't be fought.\r\n### Enia Shop: Equipment of Champions in Elden Ring\r\n### Enia Shop: Power from Remembrance in Elden Ring\r\nYou can draw out heroic powers from memories. Note that each memory can provide one power. Once that power is claimed, the memory is lost. Note that Remembrances can be duplicated at a `Walking Mausoleum`. Only one remembrance may be duplicated per mausoleum, and only one time. Using this method makes it possible to obtain both powers from the same remembrance, in the same playthrough. You cannot obtain two copies of a power in the same playthrough.\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Enia\r\nIntroduction:Roundtable Hold\r\n- *\"Are you the new Tarnished? You've done well. I am Enia, the Finger Reader\".*\r\n- *\"I interpret the words of the Fingers, envoys to the Greater Will\".*\r\n- *\"Look there. The Fingers tremble. To welcome you, shardbearer. Let their wisdom wash over you. \". Let the words of the Fingers guide you\".*\r\nWhen visiting after obtaining a `Remembrance`\r\n- *\"Well, well...I see...A remembrance of gold has found its way into your possession. Demigods, and even the greater of the champions, are hewn by the Erdtree upon their end, into remembrances. They are...valuable indeed. These remembrances yet house the power of their former masters. And should you wish to wield that same power, well... I will lend you the strength of the Fingers. Heh... Do not recoil from my offer. The Fingers guide us all. And you Tarnished, you are here to take, are you not?\"*\r\nWhen asked about Great Runes\r\n- *\"Ahh, Great Runes are the stuff of demigods: the children of the goddess, Queen Marika. She who is vessel of the Elden Ring. Tainted by the strength of their runes, her children warred, but none could become Elden Lord. And so grace was extended, to your kind, the Tarnished\".*\r\n- *\"Listen, the Fingers speak. \"\" ...Indeed. But remember one thing. The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika. Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation... The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted\".*\r\nAfter obtaining two Great Runes\r\n- *\"I had my doubts, but...my, look at you. Only once before have I seen two Great Runes together.Look there. The Fingers shudder with exuberance.The Fingers expect... As much from you as they do young Gideon.Take this. A token of farewell.**Now, go forth. Become Elden Lord.\"*\r\nWhen asked about Queen Marika\r\n- *\"Queen Marika is the vessel of the Elden Ring, carrier of its vision.A god, in truth. But after the Elden Ring's shattering, she was imprisoned in the Erdtree.A grim punishment for shattering the Order, despite her godhood. The Fingers speak...Now, you may go.\"*\r\nWhen visiting after obtaining the `Rold Medallion`\r\n- *\"Well, you managed to return.**You know what this means. The Erdtree has spurned you.**The Fingers remain still.**Shaken by this turn of events, they are busy consulting the Greater Will.**When they are finished, the Fingers will once again offer their guidance.**But thousands, if not tens of thousands, of moons must first pass.**No matter for me. But you? How will you ever manage the wait...**My, oh, my...\"*\r\n- *\"It may be thousands upon thousands of moons before the fingers again offer their guidance.My, oh, my. Whatever will you do...\"*\r\nWhen asked about burning the impenetrable thorns\r\n- *\"Heavens forbid... That is not the domain of mere men.The burning of the Erdtree is the first cardinal sin.And you say you seek power of the Rune of Death, too?The Rune of Death goes by two names; the other is Destined Death.The forbidden shadow, plucked from the Golden Order upon its creation...Unleashing the rune now would be unthinkable...The Fingers would never permit it. Nor would the Greater Will.... But here we are... The Fingers, dormant, severing our link to the Greater Will.The realm, and all life, in ruins. Impossible events transpire, beyond the ken of the Fingers.Who is to say that the cardinal sin must be cardinal forever?Go on. Finish the job. Take the course you deem most worthy.\"*\r\nWhen asked how to burn thorns\r\n- *\"You must find kindling. Only the smoldering flame in the Great Forge of the Giants, **on the highest peak in the Lands Between, can burn the Erdtree.**But special kindling is required to reignite the flame.**For the flame to burn the Erdtree, a sacrifice is needed. Of one who envisions the flame.**And can lead you to the Rune of Death.\"*\r\nAfter accessing `Crumbling Farum Azula`\r\n- *\"You've done it, I see.What use do you have for me, now?I am a Finger Reader. I will remain here, until their dialogue ends, and the Finger speak again.Do as you please. Take whatever course seems most worthy to you.Now, you may go.\"*\r\n- *\"Heh, heh, heh.You'd force this tired old crone to work, even now?A harder taskmaster I have never met.\"*\r\n- *\"Don't worry, my dear.I'll see it to the end with you, if it please.\"*\r\nLeaving\r\n- *\"Now, go forth. Let the words of the Fingers guide you\".*\r\n- (After accessing `Crumbling Farum Azula`) *\"Now, go forth. Do what you believe is right.\"*\r\nAfter completing Crumbling Farum Azula\r\n- **Cutscene narration: ***\"The Rune of Death is unbound,**and the Lands Between are shrouded by Death's dark fate.**But the flames will also burn the impenetrable thorns.**Farewell it is, then.**You'll be Elden Lord yet.\"*\r\n- Enia will no longer have any further dialogue at the Roundtable Hold, but will still redeem your remembrances and sell boss armors.\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Enia Notes & Trivia\r\n- Note that the `Fell Omen Cloak` and the `Lord of Blood's Robe` are unique items in the shop and are not a part of a set.\r\n \r\n"

He can teach some rudimentary sorceries, provided you can spare a small donation of Runes first.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Thops Location in Elden Ring\r\nThops can be found at `Church of Irith`. [`Map Link`]\r\n- This NPC will move elsewhere and become unavailable as a merchant if given the second `Academy Glintstone Key` that you acquire.\r\n- `Map Coordinates` for Thops's location after giving him an Academy Glintstone Key. He can be found dead within `Raya Lucaria Academy`, nearby the Schoolhouse Classroom Site of Grace.\r\n- You can offer to give Thops the first Academy Glintstone Key you find, but he will not accept it, since he knows that you need it to access the academy. To continue his quest line, you must give him the Academy Glintstone Key that you can find within Raya Lucaria Academy.\r\n- This merchant can be fought and slain.\r\n- Doing his quest will reward you with the `Erudition Gesture`, which is somewhat useful for solving one magic tower puzzle, and vital for completing another (provided that you also have one of the stone crowns worn by high ranking students of Raya Lucaria Academy).\r\n- If he is slain, Thops will drop 500 Runes, `Thops’s Bell Bearing`, and an `Academy Glintstone Staff`.\r\n- If found dead at Raya Lucaria Academy, you can acquire `Thops's Bell Bearing`, an `Academy Glintstone Staff,` and the sorcery `Thops's Barrier` from his body.\r\n- After Thops leaves the Church of Irith, a new Teardrop Scarab can be found near where he once sat. Slaying it will reward the player with the `Ash of War: Thops's Barrier`. \r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Thops Shop\r\n \r\n### THOPS QUESTLINE: HOW TO COMPLETE THOPS' QUEST\r\nAfter speaking with Thops and donating 10 Runes to him, Thops will share that it is his dearest wish to return to Raya Lucaria Academy to continue his studies in glintstone sorcery. Once you have obtained the `Academy Glintstone Key` found within Raya Lucaria Academy, you can then give it to **Thops**. Doing so will reward you with the `Erudition Gesture`. This gesture can be used to solve a couple puzzles found elsewhere (provided that you also have one of the stone crowns worn by high ranking students of Raya Lucaria Academy). Afterwards, Thops will leave for Raya Lucaria Academy.\r\nYou can later find him dead, sitting at a desk just outside the room containing the Schoolhouse Classroom Site of Grace within `Raya Lucaria Academy`. On his body is the sorcery Thops's Barrier, an `Academy Glintstone Staff,` and `Thops's Bell Bearing`. You can bring the Bell Bearing to the `Twin Maiden Husks` at the `Roundtable Hold` to unlock his inventory for purchase there.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Thops\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *\"You're Tarnished, aren't you?**Then, perhaps you could spare some runes?**Believe it or not, I studied glintstone sorceries at the Academy of Raya Lucaria.**For a small donation, I'd be happy to share my knowledge.\"*\r\nDonate 10 Runes\r\n- *\"Well, bless you, bless you.**You are a true saint.**My name is Thops.**Presuming you're interested, I can teach you sorceries, as promised.**Only, none of them are particularly great...\"*\r\nOn Academy Glintstone Key\r\n- *\"Why not find yourself a glintstone key?**Without one, you can't pass through the academy, and you'll never reach the Erdtree Capital.**And if you find an extra glintstone key, perhaps...**Once you've tied up all your loose ends - and I can be very patient - would you consider donating it to me?**I know it. I'm a bluntstone. Nary a hint of talent for sorcery.**But still, my place is at the academy...\"*\r\n- (If handed Academy Glintstone Key)*\"Are you certain? You re willing to give your glintstone key to me? ...My oh my! Thank you, thank you dearly.**Now I can go back to the academy. To resume my study...of glintstone sorceries, and the very stars\".*\r\n- *\"Thank you dearly. With your blessing, I will depart for the Academy of Raya Lucaria.**Perhaps, one day, you'll pay me a visit? Who knows, I may be a decorated sorcerer by then! Ha ha!\".*\r\nSmall Talk\r\n- (If you don't take any Sorcery from him)*\"Apologies, friend.I'm afraid my meagre sorceries are no match for your generosity.Oh, right.I can tell you what I know about this place. That should help a bit.You've seen that structure to the north, towering over the water?That's the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Where we study glintstone sorceries.Only, its doors have been closed for quite some time now.After they declared they wouldn't interfere with the Shattering, the academy cast repelling seals on the east gate leading to the Capital and the south gate leading here.As you might have guessed, the seals are still active, making entry to the academy impossible without a glintstone key.And so I'm stuck here. A fledgling sorcerer, with little chance of acquiring a key.When they cast the seals, I'd just popped out, and now I'm uprooted from my place of learning.\"***\r\n- *(If you buy his sorceries)**For learning my paltry sorceries.I never imagined that a bluntstone like myself would have the chance to play teacher.*\r\n- (About Sellen)*\"You've taken an apprenticeship with Sellen?Well, that is something.Sellen was well known. The most promising sorceress in the history of the academy.I followed her at school, but there may as well have been an ocean between us.But Sellen was expelled from the academy.Accused of unthinkable treatment of certain sorcerers, under the name of the Graven Witch.I still don't believe the accusations.The illustrious Sellen would never do such things...\"*\r\nVisit\r\n- *Back to learn another? Why, of course.*\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- (Entering combat)* There's no getting through to you, is there.*\r\n- (Upon killing the player)* ... Why on earth...*\r\nUpon defeat\r\n- *Oh, Raya...Lucaria... The home of my studies...*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Thops Notes & Trivia\r\n- If provoked, Thops wields a `Carian Glintstone Staff`, which he uses to cast `Glintstone Pebble`. Interestingly, the staff he uses in combat is different from the staff he drops on death.\r\n- Thops is voiced by Matthew Morgan, who also voiced `Domhnall of Zena` in Dark Souls.\r\n- Thops will not move to the Raya Lucaria Academy if he is made hostile after giving him the Academy Glintstone Key, although he will move if you then seek atonement at the `Church of Vows`.\r\n- There are actually two versions of the Academy Glintstone Key. The second one is found within Raya Lucaria Academy itself and is the only one that can be given to Thops to continue his quest.\r\n- Of the sorceries that Thops can sell, only Starlight is unique to his inventory. Glintstone Pebble and Glintstone Arc can also be purchased from another NPC in the Limgrave region. Note that owning multiple copies of the same spell does not offer any benefits.\r\n \r\n \r\n"

I Welcome you, to the Church of Vows. I am Miriel, steward of this sacred chamber. My apologies, for the unseemly state of affairs. Do you know the origin of this place?\"*\r\n- *\"Who can blame you? The Shattering has caused us - all of us - to lose sight of something very dear. It is here, at the Church of Vows, that the great houses of the Erdtree and the Moon were joined. And so, our church holds in view the monuments of both houses. The Erdtree of the Capital, and the Academy of Raya Lucaria.\"*\r\nVisit\r\n- *\"Oh, was there something you needed? You are free to show yourself around. I would serve as your guide, only my legs aren't what they used to be... If you find anything of use, you are free to take it with you.

Heresy is not native to the world; it is but a contrivance. All things can be conjoined.\"*\r\nOn `Lord Radagon`:\r\n- *\"You wish to know more of Lord Radagon? Lord Radagon was a great champion, possessed of flowing red locks. He came to these lands at the head of a great golden host, when he met Lady Rennala in battle. He soon repented his territorial aggressions though, and became husband to the Carian Queen. However, when Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was hounded from the Lands Between, Radagon left Rennala to return to the Erdtree Capital, becoming Queen Marika's second husband and King Consort, taking the title...of second Elden Lord. The mystery endures, to this day... As to why Lord Radagon would cast Lady Rennala aside... and moreover...why a mere champion would be chosen for the seat of Elden Lord\".*\r\n- *\"You know, it's said that Lord Radagon harboured a secret... A famed sculptor of the Erdtree Capital was once summoned to render Lord Radagon's likeness in giant stature. When he glimpsed the skeleton in Radagon's closet. And as such, it's said the great statue harbours his secret too\".*\r\nOn `Lady Rennala`:\r\n- *\"You wish to know more of Lady Rennala? She is Queen, head of the Carian royal family, and governor of the Academy of Raya Lucaria. The great and beautiful Full Moon Witch. Sadly, her heart was broken when Lord Radagon left her. And then, when the academy rebelled against the royals, she was locked away in the grand library.\"*\r\n- *\"In the end, Lady Rennala was left alone, cradling the amber egg Lord Radagon bequeathed her. Now she devotes herself to it through forbidden rite; the grim art of reincarnation. You would do well to remember... Severing a vow, strongest of bonds, has consequences ever more dire\".*\r\nOn Celestial Dew:\r\n- *\"Do you possess any celestial dew? Then I would like to share my knowledge with you. Concerning the miracle of this Church of Vows.**Radagon once cleansed himself with celestial dew, repented his territorial aggressions, and swore his love to Rennala. The Order of the Erdtree and the fate of the moon were conjoined, and all the wounds of war forgiven. **This miracle blesses the church to this day. And so, you need only follow Radagon's example, to restore any bond, however strained or severed, to its rightful state of harmony.\"*\r\nAbout the miracle\r\n- *\"To experience the miracle, kneel in the basin at the back, and cleanse yourself with celestial dew. Absolution will be yours. Any bond, no matter how strained, or even severed, will be put to rights.\"*\r\n*Talk*\r\n- *My faith does not waver. The miracle rooted in these grounds will, once again, mend the world. And this time, its bounty will not be squandered. If you would be Elden Lord, Tarnished, I hope that you, too, will share my faith.\"*\r\nSmall Talk\r\n- *\"Is there something else?\"*\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- *Mngh! Stop it, please. My skin is akin to stone. *\r\n- *I cannot be wounded. I cannot die. But nor will I cause any harm unto you. Cease your futile efforts.*\r\n- *Well, aren't we determined...*\r\nSpeaking to him after attacking\r\n- *Are you quite finished? Take this opportunity to learn to master your emotions. Worry not, I take no offence. But others are not always so forgiving. Some take to anger, others sorrow... Bonds are fragile things, wont to break under strain. And once they're broken, everything is lost, with naught to gain.*\r\nUpon death\r\n- *Aaa...aaargh!*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Miriel, Pastor of Vows Notes & Trivia\r\n- Miriel is a great candidate for dumping all your scrolls and prayerbooks onto, as they never change locations and teach both sorceries and incantations.\r\n- No additional dialogue is unlocked by giving Miriel all scrolls and prayerbooks, even after purchasing all sorceries and incantations from them.\r\n \r\n \r\n"

    "mainContent": "**Sorcerer Rogier** is an `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. **Rogier** uses a hat that covers his face and talks in a very polite way. He's a Sorcerer. Interacting with him could also make him available as an `NPC Summon`.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Sorcerer Rogier Information in Elden Ring\r\n**Rogier** can initially be found in `Stormveil Castle` by the altar of the Chapel in the northwest section [`Map Link`].\r\n**Rogier** presents himself and seems pretty friendly. He tells you that he is a Sorcerer and he is looking for something in the castle. He's also available as a NPC cooperator against `Margit, the Fell Omen` without needing to meet him first.\r\nRogier also acts as a `Merchant`, selling `Ashes of War`.\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Sorcerer Rogier Spells\r\n \r\n### Sorcerer Rogier Questline: How to complete Sorcerer Rogier's Quest\r\n1. Rogier can first be found in Stormveil Castle by the altar of the Chapel in the northwest section [`Map Link`]\r\n1. After defeating Godrick he will move to `Roundtable Hold`, on the balcony that overlooks the entrance hall. If you had spoken to him in Stormveil Castle before, he gives you a `Rogier's Rapier` +8 that comes with `Ash of War: Glintblade Phalanx`. (Note: You will be unable to progress Rogier's questline if you speak to `Ranni` at the `Three Sisters` in the northwest of `Liurnia` before finishing this questline.)\r\n1. Under Stormveil Castle, starting from the Liftside Grace, exit out the door to the courtyard, turn right, double back, approach the ledge that has a corpse sitting and looking down. Jump down to the buttresses below and again to the wooden scaffolding and onto the ground. Defeat the `Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit` and continue on to find what looks to be an ancient, rotting face. Just in front of the face is a bloodstain. Activate it to view a memory.\r\n1. Return to the Roundtable and ask Rogier about the face. He will explain that it is the face of Godwyn the Golden, who was the first demi-god to be killed in the event leading up to the shattering of the Elden Ring and that he was killed with a certain black knife.\r\n1. Talk to `Fia` and allow her to hold the Tarnished. Exhaust the dialogue options along the lines of \"Talk in secret\", \"Did you know?\" and \"About the Black Knifeprint\" to get the location of a `Black Knife Catacombs` [`Map link`] where a `Black Knifeprint` can be found. This step can be skipped by getting the Knifeprint without the map.\r\n1. Return the Black Knifeprint to Rogier. On reloading the area he will send you looking for Ranni, who can be found at the `Three Sisters` in the North West of Liurnia. \r\n1. Upon talking to Ranni she effectively tells the player to leave. Notifying Rogier of this development results in Rogier recommending the player become one of Ranni's Vassals to get more information from her. Rogier sends the player back to talk to Ranni again.\r\n1. Ranni will now allow the player to become one of her vassals and begin her questline. Returning to Rogier results in him warning the player that he is worried he will fall into a deep slumber - he is on the brink. Resting at the site of grace will in fact show that now he has fallen into the slumber he spoke of.\r\n1. Later on, after killing `Blaidd` at `Ranni's Rise`, he will leave behind his `Bell Bearing`, `set`, `rapier` if you didn't get it before, and a `letter` revealing the existence of D's younger brother and his whereabouts. His body and chair will mysteriously disappear on a subsequent visit.\r\n \r\n### Rogier's Dialogue in Elden Ring: Sorcerer Rogier\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Ah, nice to meet you.**The pleasure's mine. Rogier's the name. A sorcerer, as you might have guessed.**I'm looking for a little something, here in the castle. When I'm not hotfooting it from the troops, that is.**But enough about me, what are you doing here in Stormveil Castle?**This place is bristling with Tarnished hunters, you know. They sacrifice our kind, for grafting. Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind...*\r\nI'm here to defeat Godrick\r\n- *You can see it then, I take it? The guidance of grace. Well, enjoy it while you can.**I'm Tarnished, like you. But unlike you, I've seen neither hide nor hair of this guidance for the longest time. Still, I won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between.**I'm privy to a few magical battle arts. Would you care to learn one? As a fellow Tarnished, once guided by grace, I'd love to help you out, if it please.*\r\nAt Roundtable Hold\r\n- *Ah, we meet again after all.**I apologize for any offence given by my bearing, but I'm quite unable to move, you see. So. What do you need?*\r\nI've defeated Godrick\r\n- *Ah, you defeated Godrick and claimed yourself a Great Rune. Mm, looks like we both got what we wanted out of Stormveil, didn't we. **Well done, friend. Something to mark the occasion. Go on, take it.***[Gives you `Rogier's Rapier`]***As you might've guessed, I still can't move. My fighting days are behind me. No need to be polite, I've no use for it anymore.*\r\nAbout the corpse under Stormveil\r\n- *The misshapen corpse under Stormveil? That is a sacred relic. Of the black knives plot. As that famed night of assassination is known. **It happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring. Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade. And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden. **That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history. And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering.**I once wished to become a scholar, you see. I've spent many an hour scouring the archives for knowledge of that fateful plot. **The world has grown crooked, and if you intend to put it to rights, you'd better understand what happened to make it this way, mm?**And...that thing is to blame for the shape I'm in now... I urge the utmost caution. Don't disturb the corpse more than necessary...*\r\nGiving him the Black Knifeprint\r\n- *This...is a black knifeprint! I can scarcely believe you managed to get your hands on this!**You recall our conversation about the Night of the Black Knives, yes? They say the assassins who carried out the deed were scions of the Eternal City. A group entirely of women, arrayed in armour of silver under cloaks which fooled the eye.**The knives they wielded though, were imparted with the power of the Rune of Death through sinister rite.**Please, I beg of you, lend me the knifeprint for a time. I'd love nothing more than to tease out its secrets.**Though only a fragment, a very specific ritual had to be performed to impart the power of the Rune of Death. Traces of the one who performed the rite are sure to remain in the imprint...**Half my body has been suffused with Death. I'm certain it will help me see.*\r\nLater\r\n- *Ahh, hello. I was hoping to see you.My examination is complete. Here's the knifeprint back, with my thanks.***[Gives you Black Knifeprint]***Now, I have a fairly good idea who performed the rite upon the blade. The person who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives.Lunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Rennala. Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard. Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint.Truly, you have my thanks. But, if I might be so bold, I would also like to ask something more of you. If Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night, then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh. I would like you to procure it for me. And then all will be laid bare. I will have the answers I have sought for so long.*\r\nWhy do you want a cursemark?\r\n- *I'm afraid there's something I must tell you.**Do you know of Those Who Live in Death?**The very notion of life in death defies the Golden Order.**By D's account, these defiled fiends must be expunged.**But truth be told, I seek the cursemark to save them.**You may find this peculiar,**but I discovered something in my examination of the Night of the Black Knives.**These souls have committed no offence. They have every right to life, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order.*\r\nRanni cast off her cursemark\r\n- *I see... When Ranni shed her flesh, she shed the cursemark, too.You know, not everyone would trust such a tale...But, if she in her current form is nothing more than the living doll you profess...Then perhaps it's true after all.Hmm. Forgive the bluntness of the notion, but...How would you like to become one of Ranni's vassals?Ah, only in order to get what we want, of course.The location of the body which bore the cursemark, which right now I haven't the faintest.And the best way to find out is for you to enter her service and take a poke around on the sly.I know you've got what it takes.Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it.*\r\nRogier's proposition\r\n- *Can you become Ranni's vassal to advance our agenda?While in her service, you'll be able to take a poke around on the sly.And determine the location of her original body that bears the cursemark.I realise that I'm asking you to put yourself in grave danger.But I know you've got what it takes. Quite possibly the only one, in fact.*\r\nTalk (after entering Ranni's services)\r\n- *Hmm. Maybe I should tell you.Lately, I feel I'm on the precipice...Of falling into a deep...fathomless slumber.And I have an inkling it could spell trouble for you, somehow.So I just wanted to get the apology out of the way, beforehand.Since you're so scary and all.*\r\nAbout D\r\n- *Ah, so you've met D. D is an old friend. We found ourselves journeying together for a time, bound by our exploration of Death. But our paths since diverged. Never again to cross. Though that's hardly an uncommon fate for two friends. *\r\n- *D was telling me. That he discovered the mark of the centipede. The centipede is an ancient symbol of the cursemark. As long as whoever finds and uses it is not nefarious by nature, then we may be able to form an alliance. If only I could speak to them in person. And if they were like you, all the better. *\r\n- *Yes, indeed.If D knew what drives me now, he would surely boil over with rage.Or perhaps, he would even feel some pity.But no need to fret, none of that will come to pass.I can tell a good lie when I need to.*\r\nSmall Talk\r\n- *Always good to see you safe. So. What do you need?*\r\nOther\r\n- *They were conceived at the great Academy of Raya Lucaria, to the north of this castle. In the past, they obeyed laws which contravened the Golden Order, or so I'm told. **Fascinating, isn't it? That the Golden Order was pliable enough to absorb practices that contradicted itself in the past. With the Order broken, twisted, and in need of repair, such adaptability is more important now than ever.*\r\n* *\r\n### Elden Ring Notes & Trivia for Rogier\r\n- Can be summoned as a cooperator for the `Margit, The Fell Omen` boss fight. This summon sign is available long before you first find Rogier.\r\n- Rogier will move to the Roundtable Hold regardless of whether you meet him or not prior to defeating Godrick.\r\n- If you speak with D upon Rogier's arrival, D will inform you that Rogier has taken up on the Balcony near him, and remark on his condition.\r\n- Speaking with Ranni and enlisting in her service before he requests it causes him to fall asleep and then die a while later (this happens regardless of whether you do his questline or not. The only difference is gaining extra information about Ranni and the Night of the Black Knives). \n  \t- Rogier will only die if you teleport in from a different site of grace, as teleporting from the same grace will simply have him in a constant state of sleep. As long as the Site of Grace you are teleporting from is not the Roundtable's Grace, he will die as expected.\r\n\t- Rogier dying will not prevent the Ranni questline from continuing.\r\n\t- Upon his death, he will leave behind his full armor set, his bell bearing, as well as a letter. Presumably, he would also drop his sword here if by chance he dies before Godrick is defeated.\r\n\t- Interestingly enough, he will fall in deep slumber at the same time as Ranni. She mentions it after speaking with `War Counselor Iji`, `Blaidd` and `Seluvis` in her tower and then returning to her.\r\n \r\n- Gives `Rogier's Rapier+8` after defeating `Godrick the Grafted`.\r\n- The player can skip having to defeat the Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit and activating Rogier's bloodstain by obtaining the `Black Knifeprint` from the `Black Knife Catacombs` in advance. Possessing the item will unlock the dialogue option for the rotting face without ever have seeing it. This also can be done without talking with `Fia` to obtain the map with the Knifeprint's location.\r\n \r\n###  Sorcerer Rogier Image Gallery\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n"

    "mainContent": "**Boc the Seamster** is an `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. **Boc** physically appears as a demi-human monkey who is capable of advanced communication. Boc is initially met by the player in the form of a small tree.\r\nOnce you have completed Boc's questline, he appears at Graces in the Altus Plateau, and allows you to Alter equipment without paying the standard 500 rune fee. Boc does not provide any new or different alterations. \r\n \r\n \r\n### Boc the Seamster Location in Elden Ring\r\n**Boc the Seamster** can be found in multiple locations:\r\n1. **Boc the Seamster** is first encountered east of the telescope that is south of **Agheel Lake North** Site of Grace in `Limgrave`. He is disguised as a small tree and will call out to you upon approaching. [`Map Link`]\r\n1. After meeting him the first time, Boc will move to the `Coastal Cave` in western `Limgrave`. You will find him on the ground right next to the Site of Grace. [`Map Link`]- After giving Boc the Seamster the `Sewing Needle` at this second location, he will be able to appear at the following remaining four locations, depending on furthest Site of Grace that the player has rested at. Resting at any of the Site of Graces listed below, will make him appear there, in ascending order.  \n    \t- At all the following locations, he will now offer his service of altering garments.\r\n\t- At all the following locations, Boc can be given the `Gold Sewing Needle`, if you're carrying alterable boss armor (e.g. `Radahn's Lion Armor`).\r\n \r\n \r\n1. He can be found kneeling by the **Lake-Facing Cliffs** Site of Grace, north of `Stormveil Castle` in `Liurnia of the Lakes`.  You have to rest at the **Lake-Facing Cliffs** Site of Grace for him to appear. [`Map Link`]\r\n1. He can be found kneeling by the **East Raya Lucaria Gate** Site of Grace (southwest most point of the Bellum Road). You have to rest at the **East Raya Lucaria Gate** Site of Grace for him to appear. `Map Link`\r\n1. He can be found kneeling by the **Altus Highway Junction** Site of Grace in `Altus Plateau`. You have to rest at the **Altus Highway Junction** Site of Grace for him to appear. [`Map Link`]\r\n1. He can be found kneeling by the **East Capital Rampart** Site of Grace in `Leyndell Royal Capital`. You have to rest at the **East Capital Rampart** Site of Grace for him to appear. `Map Link`\r\n1. The questline now branches in one of three ways. You can either: \n  - Give him a `Larval Tear`, and upon resting, he will move next to `Rennala`. He will not respond when talked to. If you rest again, the questline will end.\r\n- Perform the `\"You're Beautiful\" Prattling Pate` in front of him, then discuss it. \r\n- Do neither of the options above. This will move him right outside of `Raya Lucaria Grand Library`, ending the questline.\r\n \r\n1. After choosing the \"You're Beautiful\" branch, telling him he's beautiful when he asks and completing the `Mountaintops of the Giants`, Boc relocates to the `East Capital Rampart` Site of Grace.\r\n \r\n### Boc the Seamster Questline: How to complete Boc the Seamster's Quest\r\nUpon first encounter, ` northwest of the Murkwater Bridge`, Boc is disguised as a tree and calling for help. If you perform an attack on the tree, the spell breaks and **Boc **returns to its original form. He will then narrate how he was expelled from his cave and had everything he owned taken, humbly rewarding you with `x10 Mushrooms`, which is everything he currently has. However, he states that if you wait, he could sneak back into the cave and retrieve some of his belongings, which could make him useful to you.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe second encounter with Boc is at `Coastal Cave`, within a few steps into the entrance tunnel, right besides the `Coastal Cave Site of Grace`. He is lying on the floor as he's been beaten up when trying to recover his belongings. In order to help him you must venture inside the cave. But beware, however, as there are many `Demi-Humans` ahead, and these creatures tend to attack in groups.At one point in `Coastal Cave` you'll reach the `Demi-Humans'` settlement, where you will encounter even more enemies and two `Demi-Human Chief` bosses. Upon defeat, these `Bosses` will drop Boc's belongings:\r\n- x1 `Tailoring Tools`\r\n- x1 `Sewing Needle`\r\nGo back to **Boc The Seamster** at `Coastal Cave's` entrance and deliver the tools to him. He will thank you and after you move, he'll no longer be at that location.\r\n***NOTE:*** It is also fine to defeat the `Demi-Human Chiefs` first and then encounter Boc by the Murkwater Bridge afterwards. Exhaust his dialogue and then return to the cave to give him the sewing materials.\r\n \r\nYou can later find **Boc The Seamster** at the `Lake-Facing Cliffs Site of Grace` in `Liurnia of the Lakes`. He is glad to see you and offers to make adjustments to your garments. \r\n- **From now on, he will be able to alter the garments of the player.**\r\n- Some armor pieces can be changed to an alternative design. This service is free of charge. This will lower the stats of the affected armor piece, but for the most part is cosmetic as the stat drop is generally very minor. (This function basicly removes the cape)\r\nHis quest can be continued if these three conditions are met:\r\n1. Retrieve the `Gold Sewing Needle` from the `Church of Vows` on the east side of `Liurnia of the Lakes`.\r\n1. Buy at least one piece of legendary boss armor that can be altered from `Finger Reader Enia` at the `Roundtable Hold`. Note that only demigod armor counts as \"legendary\", so armor such as `Briar Armor` won't work despite being alterable and sold by Enia. \r\n1. You have spoken to Melina about Boc at the East Raya Lucaria Gate Site of Grace.\r\nThis enables the option to give him the Gold Sewing Needle, which makes it possible to alter legendary armor as well. If you do not have the option to give him the gold sewing needle then, either\r\n1. You do not have the Gold Sewing Needle in your inventory\r\n1. You do not have *legendary armor that can be altered *in your inventory. Remember, like all the other (non-boss) armor found in the game, not all of it can be altered. Same rule applies to Boc and the gold needle. In addition, only armor worn by demigods is considered legendary.\r\n**NOTE**: You can skip seeing him here and still find him at later at different locations, depending on progress.\r\n \r\nBoc will leave the Lake-Facing Site of Grace after Accessing Raya Lucaria Academy and move to the East Raya Lucaria Gate Site of Grace. After speaking with him here and resting at the Site of Grace, you will then have the option to speak with Melina, who will remark on Boc.\r\n**NOTE**: You can skip seeing him here and still find him at later at different locations, depending on progress.\r\n \r\nHe can be found at `Altus Plateau` at the Altus Highway Junction Site of Grace.\r\n**NOTE**: You can skip seeing him here and still find him at later at different locations, depending on progress.\r\n \r\nHe can be found at `Altus Plateau` next to the East Capital Ramparts Site of Grace.\r\nIf not done at this point, this is the last location Boc the Seamster will appear and stay at, until giving him the `Gold Sewing Needle`.\r\nIf he now (or at any other possible location before) received the Gold Sewing Needle, his quest will continue and he will remark about his ugly appeareance and asks your opinion on it. He will imply his desire to be rebirthed by `Rennala`.\r\n**You have different choices how to proceed:**\r\n- You can give him a `Larval Tear`, and upon resting, he will move next to `Rennala`. He will be reborn into a human form, and he will not respond when talked to. If you rest again, he will die.\r\n- Alternatively, you can perform the `\"You're Beautiful\" Prattling Pate` in front of him (found in `Hermit Village` at `Mt.Gelmir`), then discuss it.\r\n- Using the Prattling Pate in front of him removes the option to give him a Larval Tear. Choose either to give him a Larval Tear **OR** use the Prattling Pate.\r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Boc The Seamster\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *\"Oi! You there! Could you help us out, cully?**You, yeah, you there! Stop pretending you can't see me\".*\r\n- *\"Why won't anyone look me in the eye?**I'm not that ugly\".*\r\nIf attacking the tree in which Boc was turned into\r\n- *\"Ow! What'd you go and do that for!**Hm? Oh, yes, I remember. Some clod turned me into a tree.**You were just breaking the spell, weren't you.**Thank you. The name's Boc.**I was pushed out of the cave. Told not to come back, not ever.**Then I ended up as a tree.**Lucky you came along, really.**Boc the seamster, at your service, Master\".*\r\n- *\"Oh, what a shame.When they threw me out of the cave, they took everything I owned, and so this is all I have to express my thanks.I hope you can forgive me\".*\r\n- *\"Or, if you can afford to wait for a while, I could sneak back into the cave, and bring back something of actual value.Then I'd be of some real use to you, I reckon\".*\r\n- *\"Right, but I'll need a moment.I-I'm frightened of them... So I have to gather myself.My knees start knockin'...just thinking bout that god-awful cave on the shore\".*\r\nAt Coastal Cave\r\n- *\"Oh... It...hurts...\"*\r\n- *\"Oh, what are you doing here?**You must leave this place at once. They'll rush in and beat you to a pulp.**You'll end up just like me\".*\r\nVisit\r\n- *\"Ready to make adjustments to your garments\".*\r\nGiving the Sewing Needle\r\n- *\"Wait, is that what I think it is? You got it back for me? My sewing needle!**What made you go and do a thing like that....**My mum was a seamstress...and that sewing kit was all I had to remember her by. **I always wanted to be just like sweet old Mum.  Then, I suppose I-I can't just curl up and die, can I?\"*\r\nAfter receiving the Sewing Needle\r\n- *\"Thank you. You're very kind\".*\r\nAt `Lake-Facing Cliffs Site of Grace`\r\n- *\"Good to see you! Master. Do you remember me? Boc, the demi-human. You helped me before, and retrieved my sewing needle.**Please, master. Allow me to serve you, as your seamster. I can't make nothing from scratch, but...I'm happy to make adjustments to your garments\".*\t- \t\t- *\"Master, I was wondering... Do you ever...make adjustments to your garb yourself? I would, well, rather you let me do the job when possible, please. I don't ask anything in return, you know, and, well... I am your personal seamster, after all!\".*\r\n \r\n \r\nDid you see it? At East Capital Rampart\r\n- *\"Master, did  you see it? Th-the Erdtree? I, oh, I don't really have the words for this...But I was so dazzled, I felt something stir, in my breast. The Erdtree is waiting for you, Master. I know it, I do. I feel it in my bones\". *\r\nLeaving\r\n- *\"Oh, going so soon? Please, do be safe on your journey\".*\r\nI'm sorry...\r\n- *\"Your wardrobe includes the garb of old demigods, and I'm afraid I can't make adjustments to them.**My mum told me once. That a royal seamster would do them up in a jiffy.**Just wait, master. Before long, I'll be that good, too!\"*\r\nAfter receiving the Gold Sewing Needle\r\n- *\"Thank you kindly. But what on earth could it... Oh!Amazing! I've never seen a golden needle, not in all my life! With a spectacular royal crest, to boot...**Are you certain that this is for me? Oh, I can hardly believe it.**Have faith in me, Master! I'll polish my craft enough that I deserve this golden gift!**I'll be the golden seamster, Boc! Now I'll be able to sew anything, even the threads of the demigods!\"*\r\nI have a favor to ask\r\n- *\"Would you mind if I called you lord? I heard that you and the other Tarnished seek the throne of the Elden Lord.**Well, I know that you will be the one, and you'd make just the manner of kind hearted lord that I'd wish for.**So, please, if you would. Allow me to call you lord.\"*\r\n- (If you say yes): *\"M'lord, m'lord, m'lord! Please become Elden Lord.**And please, let I, Boc the seamster, remain at your side.\"*\r\nSurely she'd be happy for you?\r\n- *\"That I'm as good as any royal seamster, now. Oh, it's still not enough.**I need to learn how to sew from scratch, like her.\"*\r\nHave you ever thought so?\r\n- *\"Well, they say that Rennala of Raya Lucaria has the power to help people be reborn.**Oh? Me? Reborn? Oh, look at me. When you're this ugly... well being reborn? It would hardly make a difference, I'm afraid.\"*\r\nWhat do you really think?\r\n- *\"In all honesty, what do you think of me? Am I fit to serve a lord such as you, in all my ugliness?**Must I be reborn, no matter what ill fate awaits me?**Oh, I'm such a fool. I don't even have answers to the simplest of questions\"*\r\nAfter receiving a Larval Tear\r\n- *\"Oh! Oh! It can't be... For my rebirth? But these are precious, are you certain that it's for me? **Oh... M'lord how did you know? It was my only wish, that I might honour you with a decent appearance.\"*\r\nPlease wait\r\n- *\"I'm off to see Rennala of Raya Lucaria. I'll be reborn, fresh and new.\"*\r\nAfter hearing the Prattling Pate \"You're Beautiful\"\r\n- *\"Thank you very much. Mum was always the only one who said I was beautiful.**And now, my dear lord let me hear her voice. Please, if I may dream, just once...**Do you feel the same way my mum did m'lord? Do you think I'm beautiful, despite these looks?\"*\r\n- (If you say yes): *\"M'lord, my dear lord...**I, Boc the seamster, am forever in your service. May the throne of Elden Lord be yours.\"*\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- (Before starting his quest) *\"Mum... I've... I've let you down\"*\r\n- (Warning) *\"Ow! M-m'lord? Is something wrong? It's me! Boc, the seamster!\"*\r\n- (Combat) *\"Oh, my... M'lord, is that the truth, your heart of hearts? My, oh my... Ah... aaah!\"*\r\n- (On player kill) *\"M'lord... What have I done?\"*\r\nUpon defeat\r\n- *\"M'lord... I've failed you... please, forgive me.\"*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Notes & Trivia for Boc\r\n- Voiced by Actor `Calvin A. Dean`\r\n- Boc was featured in the Elden Ring Network Test at the same location.\r\n- Boc can be killed with one hit. Once killed, Boc will not respawn, even after using `Celestial Dew`.\r\n- Despite Boc's questline involving you turning over the `Sewing Needle` and `Tailoring Tools`, you are still able to perform alterations at any Site of Grace, as the Tailoring Tools will stay in your inventory. Boc will offer the same services, simply as an alternative. \n  \t- The advantage of alterations done by Boc over a Site of Grace is that Boc will not charge you for altering clothing. Using the Tailoring Tools at a site of grace will cost Runes each time an alteration is made.\r\n \r\n- Once you obtain a demi-god armor set, you can ask Boc why he does not offer altering demi-god's garments with the \"I'm sorry...\" option. He will then provide input as to why he doesn't alter those garments due to what his mother used to tell him, and that maybe he may become good enough to do so someday.\r\n- Thanks to the latest Patch, he is easier to find in Limgrave, now that his voice triggers from a farther distance from before. An `Arteria Leaf` was also placed near him to lure players to hear him.\r\n \r\n \r\n"

I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot. Heed my warning. Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone. All the more, should you spy a mariner among their number. Unless you wish to lay down your life in vain.\"*\r\n- (If previously spoken to in Limgrave)* \"Ah... we meet again. I'm glad you took my warning to heart. Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone.

I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot. Heed my warning. The village here has been touched by Death.And worse yet, it is home to a mariner. If you value your life, then go no further.\"*\r\n- *\"The village here has been touched by death. Turn back, while you still can.\"*\r\n- (When spoken to after obtaining Deathroot) *\"Ah, a Tarnished, are you? With a prowess for weeding Deathroot.... I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot.\"* (continues into Gurranq introduction dialogue)\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- (Warning) *<wince>**\"Don't you dare. Unless you want to die like a dog?\"*\r\n- (Combat)* \"Very well. Honeyed rays of gold, deliver this spirit.\"*\r\n- (On player kill) *\"I swear, there's a blight spreading amongst the Tarnished...\"*\r\nWhen killed\r\n- *\"How could this... happen...?**Forgive me, Devin... D-Devin...\"*\r\nAfter showing Deathroot\r\n- *\"Well, well... Another fool who won't listen to reason, eh? But with a prowess for weeding Deathroot.... How would you like to earn the strength of beasts? If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot, then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.**I have a matter of my own to attend to. And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place. What say you?\"*\r\n- **[Accept introduction]** *\"Very well. Show me your map.... I've marked the location for you. Of a hidden gateway. It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.\"*(A red mark was made on the map)\r\n- *\"What is it? Still milling about? The map indicates where the gateway is hidden. It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.\"*\r\n- *\"I have a matter of my own to attend to.*(If still in Limgrave)* I spotted the mark of the centipede here in the village.*(If in the Roundtable Hold)* I've spotted the mark of the centipede*.*An ill-omened symbol that should not be. **Someone, or something, threatens the sanctity of the Golden Order. And must be eradicated.\"*\r\n- **[Decline introduction]** *\"Well, all right, then. No sense in forcing you.\"*\r\n- **[Decline introduction, then talk]*** *(If still in Limgrave)* \"What now? Had a change of heart?\"*(If in the Roundtable Hold)* \"What's wrong? Got cold feet, have you?\"*\r\nAfter accepting introduction, before meeting Gurranq\r\n- *\"Ah, hello again. You haven't gone to see Gurranq yet, have you?**Well, no rush. You do as you please.** Just as long as he doesn't starve to death, eh.\"*\r\n- *\"Go to Gurranq only if you feel the time is right. Killing Those Who Live in Death and weeding their Deathroot...Is a path not to be trod without ample resolve.\"*\r\nAfter meeting Gurranq\r\n- *\"You've met Gurranq, I take it? Then owing to our duties shared, we are now comrades-in-arms.I think you've earned this. The power of the Golden Order, to aid the hunt of Those Who Live in Death.\"*\r\nVisit\r\n- *\"Ah, hello. You've been busy weeding Deathroot, I take it. I thank you, as your brother-in-arms.**So, what can I do for you?\"*\r\n- \"*Ah, hello there. What can I do for you?*\"\r\n- *\"Did you need something else?\"*\r\nAbout D\r\n- *\"I serve the Golden Order. That I might put this crooked land to rights. Following only the guidance of the great Elden Ring. Those Who Live in Death fall outside the principles of the Golden Order.Their mere existence sullies the guidance of gold. Tainting its truth. And so it is the vermin must be exterminated... Down to the very last.\"*\r\nAbout Rogier\r\n- *\"Are you acquainted with a man named Rogier? **You know, the piteous fellow hiding away on the balcony?**He was a formidable spellblade, in times past.**Don't let his easy air deceive you. He was wise beyond his years, stout of heart and clear of mind.**No more though. **You see him now, ravaged by thorns, muttering and rambling...**Like he's half dead already. I can't stomach to watch. **Take well the lesson, friend.**That's how you end up, when seduced by Those Who Live in Death. **When grace is sullied, it rots people from the inside. Breaks them.\"*\r\nAfter showing `Weathered Dagger`\r\n- *\"Well, what have we here? How did you get your hands on that dagger? ...Well. That hardly matters. I know very well whose dagger it is. Why don't I return it to them for you? Good work, bringing this to me.\"*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring D Notes & Trivia\r\n- D, Hunter of the Dead's real name is Darian, as revealed by his twin brother after completing Fia's questline.\r\n- The name of D(arian)'s twin brother is Devin, as revealed by D(arian) if you kill him when first encountered in Limgrave.\r\n- D's name and occupation of hunting the undead is likely a reference to the title character of **Vampire Hunter D**, a series of Japanese light novels written by Hideyuki Kikuchi and illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano. \r\n- If provoked, D wields the `Inseparable Sword` and a sacred seal, which he uses to cast `Beast Claw` and (insert other spells)\r\n \r\n \r\n"

    "mainContent": "**Brother Corhyn** is an `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. **Brother Corhyn** is a holy practitioner who will teach you practical faith-based `Incantations` in exchange for `Runes`. You will encounter him once you've reached the `Roundtable Hold`.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Brother Corhyn Location in Elden Ring\r\n- Brother Corhyn can be first found at the main room in `Roundtable Hold`.\r\n- After leaving `Roundtable Hold` he can be found north of **Altus Highway Junction** Site of Grace in `Altus Plateau`. `See it on the Elden Ring Map here`.\r\n- After informing him about the location of `Goldmask`, he will move to his location in `Altus Plateau`. `See it on the Elden Ring Map here`.\r\n- After gaining access to `Leyndell, Royal Capital` he will move there together with `Goldmask`, outside the colosseum. `See it on the Elden Ring Map here`.\r\n- After solving their predicament at Leyndell, he will move to the bridge south of the `Stargazer's Ruins` together with Goldmask. `See it on the Elden Ring Map here`.\r\n- At the end of his questline, he can be found at `Leyndell, Ashen Capital`. `See it on the Elden Ring Map here`.\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Brother Corhyn Shop\r\nBrother Corhyn sells the following items:\r\n \r\n### Brother Corhyn Questline: How to complete Brother Corhyn's Quest\r\n- **Brother Corhyn** can be first met once the player is able to go to `Roundtable Hold`, he can be seen standing in the main room.\r\n- After reaching `Altus Plateau`, Brother Corhyn will tell you he is going on a journey to find the `Goldmask`. After resting, he moves to `Altus Plateau` and increases the number of Incantations he knows. Corhyn will be standing on the road north of the `Altus Highway Junction` waypoint, next to the monument where the `Map (Altus Plateau)` can be found. `See it on the Elden Ring Map here`. If you find Corhyn dead at any point in the questline, you can still complete the steps with Goldmask.\r\n- On the north side of `Altus Plateau`, there is a large broken bridge. You can encounter `Goldmask` standing on the north section of the Forest-Spanning Great Bridge, south of `East Windmill Pasture`. \n  \t- Traveling north of the Bower of Bounty grace, you can use a Spirit Spring near the bridge to jump directly up to the Goldmask.\r\n\t- Alternatively, use the waygate on the southern section of the Forest-Spanning Great Bridge, next to the Forest-Spanning Great Bridge Site of Grace.\r\n \r\n- After speaking to the `Goldmask`, you can return to Corhyn and inform him of `Goldmask`'s location. After resting, Corhyn moves to stand next to the `Goldmask` and increases his stock again. You can discuss `Goldmask` with him.\r\n- After obtaining at least two Great Runes and gaining access to Leyndell, Corhyn and `Goldmask` move to the city Leyndell, to be found on a cliff up near the colosseum and contemplating a riddle. From the `West Capital Ramparts` Site of Grace, head southwest along the balcony. The balcony will lead to a stone pathway, leading upwards to the colosseum. Follow the path, dealing with the two `Duelists` along the way. From the top of the path, head left until you find the pair. Exhaust Corhyn's dialogue about `Goldmask`. `See it on the Elden Ring Map here`.  \n  \t- *Note that if you progress far enough into the main story, Corhyn will vanish and leave behind `Corhyn's Bell Bearing` in Leyndell. In addition, Goldmask will not be present.*\r\n\t- The solution is found west of the `Erdtree Sanctuary` site of grace, down an elevator and a set of stairs. A white message on the ground facing the statue mentions \"Regression\". You must stand on the message, facing the statue, and cast the `Law of Regression` incantation to solve the riddle. Touch the new message that appears, and report the secret to `Goldmask` and then exhaust Corhyn's dialogue. \r\n\t- Casting Law of Regression requires 37 Intelligence. If desired, you can use two `Larval Tears` to respec your character and back just to solve the riddle. Alternatively, you can use a combination of intelligence-boosting equipments:\t\t- (Helm) `Haima Glintstone Crown` (+2 INT)\r\n\t\t- (Helm) `Hierodas Glintstone Crown` (+2 INT)\r\n\t\t- (Helm) `Imp Head (Cat)` (+2 INT)\r\n\t\t- (Helm) `Karolos Glintstone Crown` (+3 INT)\r\n\t\t- (Helm) `Olivinus Glintstone Crown` (+3 INT)\r\n\t\t- (Helm) `Queen's Crescent Crown` (+3 INT)\r\n\t\t- (Helm) `Witch's Glintstone Crown` (+3 INT)\r\n\t\t- (Helm) `Twinsage Glintstone Crown` (+6 INT)\r\n\t\t- (Talisman) `Marika's Scarseal` (+3 INT)\r\n\t\t- (Talisman) `Marika's Soreseal` (+5 INT)\r\n\t\t- (Talisman) `Stargazer Heirloom` (+5 INT)\r\n\t\t- (Great Rune) `Godrick's Great Rune` (+5 INT) - requires consuming a Rune Arc to activate the buff, after which it will last until death\r\n\t\t- (Weapon) `Grafted Blade Greatsword` (+5 INT) - Using the special skill boosts all stats by 5. Using the skill requires 14 DEX and 40 STR *(27 when 2-handed)*\r\n\t\t- (Flask of Wondrous Physick) `Intelligence-knot Crystal Tear` (+10 INT) - lasts for 3 minutes upon consuming the flask\r\n \r\n\t- After casting the spell, revealing a plot-point, go back to Goldmask and tell him what you found out. \n    \t\t- After this you can talk to Brother Corhyn and he will offer to sell you the `Immutable Shield` incantation.\r\n \r\n \r\n- Upon reload, `Goldmask` and Corhyn will move to the bridge south of Stargazers' Ruins. `See it on the Elden Ring Map here`. \n  \t- A dialogue option also appears to give Brother Corhyn the `Tonic of Forgetfulness` upon advancing his questline to Mountaintops of the Giants near the Stargazers' Ruins. Brother Corhyn will refuse the potion and the item will remain in the player's inventory.\r\n \r\n- After completing `Crumbling Farum Azula`, `Goldmask` can be found in Leyndell, Ashen Capital on the bottom of the colosseum cliffs facing the west side of the `Erdtree Sanctuary` Site of Grace.. He will give you the `Mending Rune of Perfect Order`. Reload the area to loot `Goldmask's Set`\r\n- Corhyn can then be found at one of the possible two locations: \n  \t- *Corhyn location 1*: It is advisable to check for him here first, as the game loads you into `Leyndell, Capital of Ash` after you finish the main boss fight at Crumbling Farum Azula. He will be near the base of the giant spiral spear. Speak with him to exhaust all dialogue and then, after reloading the area, you can find `Corhyn's Bell Bearing` and `Corhyn's Robe` where he was sitting. `See this location on the Elden Ring Map here`.\r\n\t- *...or...*\r\n\t- *Corhyn location 2*: Southeast of `Stargazers' Ruins`. He's on the bridge that connects Stargazer's Ruins with a Minor Erdtree (to the east of Stargazer's Ruins). It's the exact same place you came across him and `Goldmask`, earlier in their quest, if you'd been following his/ their quest up to this point. Use the interactive map and check the snow area to locate Stargazer's Ruins. Now look a little east of there to locate the Minor Erdtree. Sitting just to the upper left of the map drawing of the Minor Erdtree is a the Site of Grace: `Snow Valley Ruins Overlook`. You can fast travel there, mount your horse and head west. Keeping the cliff to your left, you'll come across a bridge. Cross over this (you should be heading south/ southeast) and then keep heading southeast to reach the second bridge with Corhyn. Same as \"Corhyn location 1\", exhaust all dialogue. Reload the area. Claim his loot where he was sitting.\r\n \r\n- **Note**: If Corhyn never leaves Roundtable Hold, you can find both `Corhyn's Bell Bearing` and `Corhyn's Robe` where he usually stands after setting the Erdtree aflame.\r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Brother Corhyn\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Oh, I see you've just arrived. Welcome to the Roundtable Hold. I'm Corhyn, a man of the cloth.**I teach incantations, the strength granted us by the Two Fingers, **and explore the secrets of the Golden Order.**So that one day, if a Tarnished of the Roundtable Hold should become Elden Lord, I might counsel them,**ensuring order regains its proper form, righting rule over men.**By the way, do you still see it? The guidance of grace.*\r\n- *You do! Wonderful news. **Most Tarnished are blind to it these days.**You are something of a rare breed. **Well, what do you say?**Care to learn an incantation of the Two Fingers?*\r\nVisit\r\n- Visit dialogue goes here.\r\nAltus Plateau\r\n- *Ah, look who we have here. How delightful, to meet a familiar face, even after departing the Roundtable Hold. I've been doing some learning of my own since then, actually. And will happily pass it along to you. *\r\n- [About the noble Goldmask]* I'm yet to find the noble Goldmask. I suppose he'll be closer to the Erdtree. The path ahead might be perilous, but tread it I shall. Since departing the Roundtable Hold, I've come to understand, in my solitude, how little it is I truly know...*\r\n- [Tell the noble Goldmaks's whereabouts]* Do...do you sport with me!? From your description, it can be no other than the Goldmask himself! Of course, of course, I knew he would be close by. Bless the Golden Order, and its benevolent rays. And to you too. My sincerest thanks. *\r\nBridge above Road of Iniquity Side Path\r\n- *Ah, we meet yet again. Thanks to you, I have become acquainted with the noble Goldmask himself, and taken my place by his side as you can see. Have no fear, I will still teach you incantations, as before. Though we must do so quietly, such that we do not disturb the great master's cogitation.*\r\n- [About the noble Goldmask] *The master is always deep in contemplation. While I frantically attempt to record his wisdom; the movement of his finger. And though I am yet to comprehend the daintiest morsel of his wisdom... I know that this, this is my life's calling. The Golden Order has bestowed me, talentless as I am, the great duty of documentarian.*\r\nAt Leyndell, Royal Capital\r\n- [To Goldmask]* Master! What ever is the matter? Please, I implore you continue! Continue your reflections, your rhythms! I must be the one to record them! What matters this issue of Radagon, really? The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes! Why must these qualms come to you now? We were on the very cusp!*\r\n- *Oh, was that you? Sorry, I hardly noticed. I'm a little shaken since the master ceased his movements.*\r\n- *The master's reflections had heightened as we neared the Erdtree. While still a precise calculus, the rhythms grew increasingly wild. Until he simply ceased. Now the master is facing quite the puzzle. The Golden Order is founded on the principle that Marika is the one true god. However... The name of Marika's second husband, King Consort Radagon, also appeared. Who exactly was Radagon? The master is stumped. His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered. Curse my mediocre mind. The master only has me; and here I fail him.*\r\n- [After telling Goldmask the statue's secret]* What on Earth did you do to the master? Well, not that I'm complaining. Master's finger moves again, resuming his cogitation; more than good enough for me. I haven't the words to thank you. So I'd like to pass this on to you instead. A glimpse into the heart of the Golden Order, documented by yours truly.*\r\n- [After telling Goldmask the statue's secret]* To think, that Radagon was Marika herself. Or at least, such is all I can interpret from the rhythm and calculus of his finger. How would such a thing even have been possible, I wonder. Sadly, I cannot comprehend it myself. Do you have a fuller understanding of the matter? Well, either way, I can continue my documentation. In truth, it matters very little whether I understand the master's thoughts or not. I am merely his scribe. It is my sole and unwavering purpose.*\r\nAt Stargazers' Ruins Bridge\r\n- *Ah, nice to see you. I can't believe you've come all this way.*\r\n- *I've been gripped by a terrifying thought. The rhythms and calculus of the master's finger... betray a suspicion of the holism of the Golden Order. A conceit, I am afraid, that cannot be overlooked. Oh, but how could this be? I dread to even entertain the possibility, but somehow, I cannot cast aside my doubts about the master. Tell me, have I simply lost me head. Only, if the master were true to the Golden Order, why would he think to breach this forbidden mount of fire?*\r\n- *Oh master, put my mind at ease. Dispel these fearsome thoughts. I want to place my trust in you, to be your scribe.*\r\n- [Offering the Tonic of Forgetfulness]* It will make me forget, you say? So that I can push aside these frightful thoughts... Ha... ha ha... Would that I could... Would that I could...*\r\nAt Leyndell, Capital of Ash\r\n- *Oh, it's you. I've finally come to understand. **The master was nothing more than a madman. **Enchanted by a vain and ruinous delusion, he rejected the perfection of the Golden Order, **seeking to supplant our glorious faith with his own! **Could there be a more pitiable comedy? **Look at it. The culmination of perfection, burning, before our very eyes! **Ha... ha ha ha...*\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- (Warning) *Ngh!**What are you trying to achieve? Cease that!*\r\n- (Combat) *You've done it now. Faith grants me strength, that I might endure. O Golden Order, shine through me.*\r\n- (On player kill)* Please don't trouble us again.*\r\nUpon defeat\r\n- *O guidance...of grace... Why...can't I*\r\n- (With Goldmask)* O master... To be ever at your side...*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Brother Corhyn Notes & Trivia\r\n- After meeting **Brother Corhyn** for the first time, you'll receive the `Prayer Gesture`.\r\n- Killing this NPC doesn't mark you as a sinner.\r\n- If provoked, Corhyn wields a `Flail` and a sacred seal, which he uses to cast `Heal` and (insert other spells)\r\n \r\n### Brother Corhyn Image Gallery\r\n \r\n *Brother Corhyn at Leyndell, Ashen Capital, at the end of his questline.*\r\n \r\n \r\n"

    "mainContent": "**Gurranq, Beast Clergyman** is an `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. **Gurranq** appears to be a large, hunched creature that possesses many beast-like qualities. Constantly hungering for Deathroot, he will reward those who feed him. \r\n \r\n### Gurranq, Beast Clergyman Location in Elden Ring\r\n**Gurranq, Beast Clergyman** can be found at the Bestial Sanctum in north-east Caelid [`Elden Ring Map here`]. This location can be accessed via a waygate in `Limgrave` [`Elden Ring Map here`]\r\n- This NPC does not move\r\n- This merchant can be fought\r\n- If defeated, drops: `Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone`\r\n- As of 1.03, dialogue will not advance after the fourth deathroot unless you walk away and/or rest to trigger an event. \n  \t- The event must be triggered before dialogue continues if giving a single root at a time\r\n\t- Multiple deathroots at a time, or continuing before event trigger skips lore dialogue\r\n\t- All rewards will be given after event resolution if given more than one at a time\r\n \r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Gurranq, Beast Clergyman Shop\r\n \r\n### Gurranq Beast Clergyman Questline: How to complete Gurranq Beast Clergyman's Quest\r\nPlayers should go to Summonwater Village and defeat the `Tibia Mariner` boss there, then return to D at the `Rountable Hold` to continue his quest. He will give you directions to go to the `Bestial Sanctum` in `Caelid`. You can teleport there without having to explore by going to the \"Sending Gate\" in East Limgrave (`See it in the interactive Map`).\r\nAfter the fourth Deathroot he will become hostile towards you which then you will have to whittle his hp down until he stops attacking, then you can speak with him and then reset the area and use the fifth Deathroot for the `Beast Claw` Incantation. If you gave him the fifth Deathroot before he went aggressive, he will immediately give you the `Beast Claw` Incantation upon speaking to him after subduing him.\r\nYou can also choose to not talk to him after he stops attacking and kill him instead. This will make him drop the Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone without completing his quest.\r\n- A tip for those who are finding this difficult: if you can aggro and bait `Black Blade Kindred` just outside to use it's big red swipe, it can one-shot Gurranq into submission.\r\n- You can also bait him at the entrance (he can and will hit you through the gates and walls), back away far enough and use `Night Maiden's Mist` (charged for extra radius) to slowly whittle down his HP. Do note that he will remain agressive until you reset the area.\r\n- If you have a summons that has rot or poison, such as a `Rotten Stray Ashes` or `Spirit Jellyfish Ashes`, you can poison the `Beast Clergyman` and simply wait outside while the damage ticks. It will eventually reach the threshold to break the Beast Clergyman out of his rage and reset him back to normal. Port out and port back to find him in his normal spot.\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Gurranq, Beast Clergyman information\r\n- Health: \r\n- Poise: \r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Gurranq, Beast Clergyman\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *\"...\" (grunting, snarling)*\r\nFirst `Deathroot`-\r\n- \r\n- \r\nSecond and Third `Deathroot`-\r\n- \"...\" *(grunting, snarling)*\r\n- \"More... I am not sated... Feed me more... Death.\"\r\nFouth `Deathroot`-\r\n- \"Strange, there's something else. But the death, yet quenches. Bring more.\"**\r\n (if you feed the fifth `Deathroot` before you rest or leave to trigger him going aggressive, you get this message)\r\n- \"...\"\r\n- \"More... I am not... sated... Feed me more... Death\"\r\nUpon doing enough damage after feeding the fourth `Deathroot`-\r\n- *(gasping and groaning)*\r\n- \"Put it away. I won't forget... again... mine appetite... My sin... So please.... Enough.\"\r\nFifth `Deathroot`-\r\n- \"My thanks Tarnished.... Death... My sin... Should not be touched by the hand of man... I shall grant thee... my claws... Feed me... more...\"\r\nSixth,  Seventh & Eighth `Deathroot`-\r\n- \"I won't forget... again.... mine appetite... My sin... I must have more... I must consume more...\"\r\nNinth `Deathroot`\r\n- \"It is... it is all... consumed. Still., I am not sated... Not nearly sated...\" \r\n- *(screams) * \"Marika... Is this... what it is... to sin?\" \"Will things... never be the same... again?\" \"...\" *(panting)*\r\n- \"Tarnished... my thanks... for thy... long labor. But I have done... all I can... in this land. Henceforth, mine appetite shall be my sole companion. Farewell.\"\r\nSmall Talk\r\n- *\"...\" (grunting)*\r\nOther\r\n- *More... I am not Sated.*\r\n- *Bring me more Death.*\r\nWhen he killed Tarnished\r\n- *I must consume more...*\r\nUpon death\r\n- *Marika...why...wouldst thou...gull me? Why...shatter...*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Gurranq, Beast Clergyman Notes & Trivia\r\n- Further into the game's progression, **Gurranq** becomes a Boss fight. `Details here.` He will still remain even after being defeated as a boss, if they player did not finish his questline.\r\n- At night, Gurranq can be found to the right side of the sanctum, howling at the sky. Talking to him when he does this does not grant new dialogue. \r\n- A total of 9 Deathroot can be given to him to finish his questline.  \n  \t- Once all 9 Deathroot have been given to him, he will tell the player that despite their hard work, his hunger is still not satiated and that he will go on to be alone. He will then roar and vanish, giving the player an `Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone`.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"

After the `second Volcano Manor request`, Bernahl will give you `Letter to Bernahl`, a co-op `Volcano Manor` invasion mission against `Vargram the Raging Wolf` and `Errant Sorcerer Wilhelm` in `Leyndell, Royal Capital`. He gives you `Gelmir's Fury` as a reward. This step is unavailable and skipped if the player has already cleared `Crumbling Farum Azula`.\r\n1. `NPC Summons`: Can be summoned for the `Godskin Duo` fight in `Crumbling Farum Azula`. You can find his summon sign by starting at the Dragon Temple Transept site of grace and going up the narrow staircase.\r\n1. After `Rykard` has been killed and the `Volcano Manor` emptied, you'll be invaded by **Recusant Bernahl** in `Crumbling Farum Azula` in the walkway to the `Old Lord's Talisman` treasure chest, after passing the `Beside the Great Bridge` `Site of Grace`. [`Map Link`]- As of Patch 1.03, the invasion can happen even if the player has defeated all Crumbling Farum Azula area bosses, but in previous patches this was also missable.\r\n- Until this happens, his sword will be present on his chair in Volcano Manor and you can continue to learn skills from it.\r\n \r\nWhen defeated, **Recusant Bernahl** drops:\r\n- `Blasphemous Claw`\r\n- `Devourer's Scepter`\r\n- `Beast Champion Helm`\r\n- `Beast Champion Armor (Altered)`\r\n- `Beast Champion Gauntlets`\r\n- `Beast Champion Greaves`\r\n- `Bernahl's Bell Bearing` (not dropped from Invader form)\r\n \r\n- This NPC moves location depending on game's progress.\r\n- This merchant can be fought.\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Knight Bernahl Shop\r\n \r\n### Knight Bernahl Questline: How to complete Knight Bernahl's Quest\r\n- After completing the second assassination as part of  the `Volcano Manor` questline and talking to **Bernahl**, he gives you the `Letter to Bernahl` outlining two assassination targets and invites you to take them out together.\r\n- When you return to your world after helping **Bernahl** with his invasion, you are rewarded with the `Raging Wolf Set`. \r\n- **Bernahl** will award you with the `Gelmir's Fury` sorcery spell after reporting back to him at `Volcano Manor`\r\n- Make sure to complete **Bernahl's** quest as well as the rest of the `Volcano Manor` quests before defeating `Rykard` as these NPCs will disappear from the Volcano Manor afterwards\r\n- Bernahl will invade in Crumbling Farum Azula. From beside the great bridge, turn towards the dragon temple to the north. Go into the temple, and make your way to the eastern lone tower. He'll invade by it's door, dropping his armor set, the `Devourer's Scepter`, and the `Blasphemous Claw` usable item. Note: As of patch 1.03, Bernahl will still be able to invade even after both area bosses have been defeated, where he would not have prior. \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Knight Bernahl\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Not seen you before. **Name's Bernahl. Tarnished, just like you. **Let me ask you something. **Are you here in the Lands Between to take up the fight? **Does your faith in the guidance of grace hold firm, despite the collapse of the Golden Order?*\r\nIf *\"My faith holds firm\"* option is chosen\r\n- *Yes, you're a Tarnished through and through. **Takes me back, but that's a quality needed now more than ever. **Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts? **All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too. **Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good and proper Tarnished, like you.*\r\nIf \"I'm not sure\" option is chosen\r\n- *Honest to a fault, I see. Such thoughts won't behoove you as a Tarnished. But there’s nothing wrong with that. Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts? All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too. Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good and proper Tarnished, like you.*\r\nSmall Talk\r\n- *There's a myriad of battle arts in these lands that I've yet to discover. **Mementos of all the warriors who raised their arms in battle, lost, and died. **A fine tale, all told, of true chivalric romance. That's how I fell in love with the sword, and the arts of combat. It grants meaning even to falling in battle, to death itself.*\r\nOther\r\n- **No Purchase Made:** *Not floating your boat, eh? Well, there's no rush. Knowledge of the arts can wait another day.*\r\n- **Purchase Made: ***Well, until we meet again.*\r\n- **After Purchasing and selecting 'leave': ***Oh, not had your fill, eh? Worry not, I've enough to keep you busy.*\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- (Combat)* I suppose I have no choice, then. Is this what grace would have of us?*\r\n- (On player kill)* Dog eat dog, once again. A sad lot, we Tarnished.*\r\nUpon defeat\r\n- *You are an enigma, to be certain. The Volcano Manor awaits you.*\r\nAt Volcano Manor\r\n- *You... What in heaven's name are you doing here? The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind. **I hope you understand the weight of my words.*\r\n- (I understand) *Well. As long as you understand what you're saying. I thought you a Tarnished bred by virtue. **Perhaps playing that part led you to your doubts, I wonder. **But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and lead only to a miserable death. Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.*\r\nAfter completing one Volcano Manor quest\r\n- *So. You've bloodied your sword in the hunt. Then I shall introduce myself once more.**Bernahl, a recusant, just like you. Recusants have particular battle arts, styled to our methods of slaughter.**Why not add some to your repertoire?*\r\n- *To take power and make it his own, The recusant must hunt his own kind. To raise the flag of revolt against this sanctified pillaging. **We recusants must become the most wretched of predators. All you can do is laugh.*\r\nAfter completing two Volcano Manor quest\r\n- *Look at you. A recusant through and through. I knew you had it in you. Take this.*\r\n- *A special invitation, to hunt some of the first Tarnished who sat at the Roundtable Hold.**If you should accept, I'll next see you on the field of battle.*\r\nAfter completing his quest\r\n- *Ah, I had hoped you'd soon return. I have the reward from Lady Tanith.**Take it. It's yours, by right.*\r\n- *Let us tread the path of the recusant together. Till we reach the miserable death that awaits us.*\r\nAfter defeating Rykard\r\n- *So. You killed Rykard? I harbour you no ill will. The strong take. Such is our code.**Even he was prepared to meet a wretched end when he first took blasphemy unto his very flesh.**But anyroad, the Volcano Manor is no more. Though we may yet fulfil an old promise.**We hunted our own kind, and took what was theirs. And with everything in hand, the time has come to rise, against the Erdtree.*\r\n- *O Greater Will, hear my voice. I am the recusant Bernahl, inheritor of my brother's will, and you will fall to my blade.**We refuse to become your pawns. Consider this fair warning.*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Knight Bernahl Notes & Trivia\r\n- If Knight Bernahl is not inside the ruin `Warmaster's Shack`, entering will instead spawn a field boss named `Bell Bearing Hunter`.\r\n- If you do not talk to Bernahl at all he will never leave the Manor and never invade you. You can return to him at any point to exhaust his dialogue. He will then disappear from the Manor and invade you at the Crumbling Farum Azula.\r\n- If Bernahl is provoked while at the Warmaster's Shack, he wields a `Zweihander` and a sacred seal, which he uses to cast (insert spells here)\r\n- After he moves to the Volcano Manor, he uses the `Devourer's Scepter` in combat instead of a Zweihander \r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Knight Bernahl Image Gallery\r\n`` ``\r\n \r\n"

    "mainContent": "**Melina** is an `NPC` in `Elden Ring` who acts as a guide to the player throughout the game's narrative. She is a mysterious young lady seen in an opening cutscene with `Torrent, the Spirit Steed`, and first met at the beginning of the Tarnished's journey*. ***Melina** wears a black robe and approaches players while they are resting at different `Sites of Grace`. She offers guidance throughout the game, grants the ability to level up and teleports you to certain key areas. She also later becomes available as an `NPC Summon`.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Melina Location in Elden Ring\r\n- **Melina** will reveal herself at different `Sites of Grace` along the game's storyline. The player is also able to converse with her via a *Talk to Melina* option when sitting at other Sites of Grace even when she does not automatically appear.\r\n- **Melina** is first met after resting on a Site of Grace in the overland outside of the `Church of Elleh`. The earliest Site of Grace players can access that fulfill this condition is the  Site of Grace, by `Gatefront Ruins`. \r\n- When activating a Site of Grace on the overland that is located outside of Limgrave and Weeping Peninsula, resting upon one will trigger dialogue after which Melina will transport the player to the `Roundtable Hold`. The common Sites of Grace that trigger this are the  in `Liurnia of the Lakes`, and  or  in `Caelid`. These locations can be accessed relatively early if the player knows how to reach them. (Sellia Under-Stair can be reached the earliest, through a transporter trap chest in a basement cellar in `Dragon-Burnt Ruins` that brings the player to `Sellia Crystal Tunnel`, from which they can exit to find the  Site of Grace).\r\n- `NPC Summon`: `Morgott, the Omen King`. Progress in the `Melina` questline until she leaves. Her summon sign is at the top of the stairs on the right, in front of the fog gate. She wields the `Blade of Calling` and uses faith-based Erdtree/healing `incantations`.\r\n \r\n### Melina Questline: How to complete Melina's Quest\r\n- After resting at a Site of Grace (outside of the ) on the overland, **Melina** will manifest herself and reflect on the absence of a guidance during your journey so far, appearing out of the air with a blueish aura around her. **Melina** proposes an accord: to act as your *Maiden*, that is, as a guide throughout your journey, for you are \"*Maidenless*\". In exchange, she requests you take her with you to the *Erdtree*. She volunteers to \"*turn your `Runes` into strength*\", enabling you to level up your character. She will also bequeath a ring, the `Spectral Steed Whistle`, allowing you to summon the spectral steed Torrent who has \"*chosen you*\".\r\n- At the next site of grace you rest at before entering `Stormveil Castle,` selecting the Talk to Melina option will trigger a conversation about the sites of grace. During this, **Melina** conveys the golden auras at the different `Sites of Grace` are in fact the grace of the *Erdtree*, and by following them, the grace will guide you through your burden. She informs you that a Shardbearer resides in Stormveil Castle, and that if the rays signal the castle, the Elden Ring is beckoning you.\r\n- At the next site of grace you rest at before entering `Stormveil Castle`, selecting the Talk to Melina option will trigger a conversation with Melina about her purpose, where she describes her search for her purpose and also apologises for acting as a Finger Maiden whilst being unable to offer guidance, as she is \"*no maiden*\" and without purpose.\r\n- At the `Third Church of Marika`, when resting at the grace and selecting the Talk to Melina option, Melina will appear and declare that spoken echoes of Queen Marika the Eternal are present, and if you wish she will convey them to you. Select the \"I'm interested\" dialogue and she will continue to describe the echoes.\r\n- At the `Church of Pilgrimage`, in the North of the `Weeping Peninsula`, when resting at the grace and selecting the Talk to Melina option, Melina will again appear and give the option to elucidate on the echoes.\r\n- Upon reaching the  site of grace (or any Grace in Leyndell), Melina will appear and say that she will be leaving, but that she will let you keep Torrent and the ability to turn runes into power. She reasserts her confidence that you will become the Elden Lord.\r\n- Melina may be summoned for the fight against `Morgott, the Omen King` via a sign directly outside the boss arena.\r\n- After defeating `Morgott`, trying and failing to enter the `Erdtree` and resting at the * *Site of Grace, Melina appears. She offers a new accord - to bring her \"*to the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon snowy mountaintops of the giants*\", so she can set the Erdtree aflame, and help you become *Elden Lord*.\r\n- Melina will then have additional dialogue when resting at certain Sites of Grace, the `Godric the Grafted Grace` for example. She will remind the player of the new goal in the land of the giants. She can then be spoken to a second time, and she will say that although her purpose was giving to her by her mother, she is now acting on her own volition and has \"set [her] heart upon the world that [she] would have. Regardless of [her] mother's designs.\"\r\n- Melina must be talked to in the `Forge of the Giants Grace,` and her quest will be fulfilled. \n  \t- If the player has inherited the Frenzied Flame despite Melina pleading them not to do it, Melina will not appear in this grace. Instead, she will appear after the ending of the game if the player continues with the Frenzied Flame path, and will threaten the Lord of Frenzied Flame with Destined Death.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Melina Dialogue in Elden Ring\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Greetings. Traveller from beyond the fog. I Am Melina. I offer you an accord.*\r\n- *Have you heard of the finger maidens? They serve the Two Fingers, offering guidance, and aid, to the Tarnished. But you, I am afraid, are maidenless. **I can play the role of maiden. Turning rune fragments into strength. To aid you in your search for the Elden Ring. You need only take me with you. To the foot of the Erdtree.*\r\nIf Accepting\r\n- *Then its settled. Summon me by grace to turn runes into strength. Ahh, another matter. I bequeath to you this ring. ****Use it to traverse great distances. It will summon a spectral steed named Torrent. Torrent has chosen you. Treat him with respect.*\r\nIf Refusing\r\n- *I understand. I'm asking you to put faith in but a stranger. Yet I'm certain that we can reach an understanding.Summon me by grace if you should reconsider.*\r\nMore on Melina\r\n- *This tiny golden aura is the grace of the Erdtree. This light once shone in the eyes of your Tarnished brethren.**But now it is all that guides you. Or so I hear. The rays of grace, that guide you through your burden.**Upon the cliff, in `Castle Stormveil`, is a shardbearer. A **demigod** who inherited a fragment of the shattered Elden Ring.**If the rays of grace signal the castle, **then the Elden Ring beckons you.**As an ally by pact,**...I pray that you are fit... **To face the challenge presented by the Ring.*\r\nWhen Leveling Up\r\n- *Shall I turn your runes to strength? Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.Share them with me, your thoughts, your ambitions, the principles you would follow.*\r\nPurpose\r\n- *Me, I'm searching for my purpose given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree long ago, for the reason that I yet live, burned and bodyless.There is something for which I must apologize. I've acted the finger maiden yet I can offer no guidance, I am no maiden.My purpose was long ago lost...*\r\nWhen resting at Third Church of Marika\r\n- *Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here, as well. **Shall I share them with you?*\r\n- *Very well. In Marika's own words. **My Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace.**With thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between. **Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.**Well? Perhaps that might serve you in lieu of a maiden's guidance.*\r\nWhen resting at Church of Pilgrimage\r\n- *Spoken echoes linger here. Words of Queen Makira, who vanished long ago. If you wish, I will share them with you.*\r\n- *In Marika's own words.**Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed.**Return to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring.**Grow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord. Lord Godfrey.*\r\nWhen resting at the Grand Lift of Dectus Site of Grace\r\n- *Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?*\r\n- *In Marika's own words. The Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine. Become one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it. To wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart.*\r\nWhen resting at Altus Plateau\r\n- *The Erdtree...is close. Only a little further till the foot of the Erdtree, and the accord is fulfilled. It takes me back. I was born at the foot of the Erdtree. Where mother gave me my purpose. Though now, everything is lost to me. I...have to ascertain for myself. The reason for which I live, burned and bodiless.*\r\nAbout Boc\r\n- *Your seamster, Boc... I see him crying, from time to time. I think he misses his mother. He wants someone to tell him he's beautiful. Does being born of a mother... Mean one behaves in such a manner?*\r\nWhen resting at the Capital Outskirts\r\n- *Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?*\r\n- *In Marika's own words. Hear me, Demigods. My children beloved. Make of thyselves that which ye desire. Be it a Lord. Be it a God. But should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken. Amounting only to sacrifices...*\r\nWhen resting at the Queen's Bedchamber after defeating Morgott, the Omen King\r\n- *Spoken echoes linger here. Words of Queen Makira, who vanished long ago. If you wish, I will share them with you.**In Marika's own words. O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order. Thou'rt yet to become me, thou'rt yet to become a god. Let us both be shattered, mine other half*\r\nWhen resting at Minor Erdtree Church\r\n- *Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?*\r\n- *In Marika's own words. I declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order. Through understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased. Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past. My comrades; why must ye falter?*\r\nUpon defeating `Margit, The Fell Omen`, or when first resting at a non-dungeon `Site of Grace` outside of `Limgrave` (most likely trigger would be `Caelid`'s Sellia Under-Stair, found outside of `Sellia Crystal Tunnel`, which is reachable through being ensnared by `Dragon-Burnt Ruins`' transporter trap chest)\r\n- *Forgive me. I've been...testing you. To see whether or not grace truly does guide you.**And...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails. It seems my worries were unfounded.**Torrent had your measure from the very start. Whereas I merely pretended.**There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance.**I can take you to the Roundtable Hold... Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace...*\r\n- *Very well. Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.*\r\nWhen reaching Leyndell, she can appear once you reach the East Rampart site of grace.\r\n- *My utmost thanks. For bringing me to the base of the Erdtree. Here, I can govern my own movement. And thus, the accord is fullfiled. I shall depart to ascertain the purpose I was given. Farewell. I shall leave Torrent, and the power to turn runes into strength, here with you. I wish you luck, in realising your ambition. You have fought long and hard. I have no doubt you will become Elden Lord. May you take the throne.*\r\nWhen being unable to enter the Erdtree, she appears at the near site of grace.\r\n- *Hello again, old friend. Allow me a moment to converse with you. You were unable to enter the Erdtree, no? Prevented by the mantle of barbs. The thorns are impenetrable. A husk of the Erdtree's being; that spurns all that exists without. The only way to stand before the Elden Ring...and become the Elden Lord...is to pass the thorns. My purpose serves to aid in that very act. So I'd like you to undertake a new journey, with me. To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snow mountaintops of the giants. The I can set the Erdtree aflame. And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord. (*She gives the player a `Rold Medallion` and makes a red mark on the map.)\r\nUpon resting at the `Frenzied Flame Proscription` Site of Grace in the Cathedral of the Forsaken in Leyndell, Capitol of Ash\r\n- *If you intend to claim the Frenzied Flame, I ask that you cease. It is not to be meddled with. It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending. However ruined this world has become, however mired in torment and despair, life endures. Births continue. There is beauty in that, is there not? If you would become Lord, do not deny this notion. Please, leave the Frenzied Flame alone.*\r\n- *I ask you, one more time. Please, seek not the Frenzied Flame. As one who strives to become a Lord, deny not the lives, the new births of this world. Those who would are not fit to be called Lord. When the land they preside over is lifeless.*\r\n- *Please put a stop to this madness. The Lord of Frenzied Flame is no lord at all. When the land they preside over is lifeless.*\r\nAfter speaking to `Enia` about burning the thorns\r\n- *\"Think not, of the kindling. I shall see to that.**All I ask of you is to make the journey.**To the snowy mountaintops of the giants, far above the clouds.**I know... I'm asking you to commit a cardinal sin.**But it must be done to reach the path beyond.**And that is the path I wish to travel.**What is your mind?\"*\r\nUpon resting at the Snow Valley Ruins Overlook Site of Grace\r\n- *There is something I'd like to say. My purpose was given to me by my mother. But now, I act of my own volition.I have set my heart upon the world that I would have. Regardless of my mother's designs.I won't allow anyone to speak ill of that. Not even you.*\r\nWhen resting at First Church of Marika Site of Grace\r\n- *Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?**In Marika's own words. Hark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds. Guidance has delivered ye through ordeal to the place ye stand. Put the giants to the sword and confine the flame atop the mount. Let a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life. Brandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree!*\r\n- *We are almost there. The flame of ruin lies just ahead. I'm glad it was you I traveled with. I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too. Thank you, Torrent. Please continue to lend your aid. Till the end.*\r\nUpon resting at the Giants' Gravepost Site of Grace and selecting \"Talk to Melina\". `Flame Peak`, `Mountaintops of the Giants`.\r\n- *We're almost there. The flame of ruin lies just ahead. I'm glad it was you I travelled with. I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too. Thank you, Torrent. Please continue to lend your aid. Till the end.*\r\nUpon resting at the Forge of the Giants Site of Grace in Mountaintops of the Giants.\r\n- *I have long observed the Lands Between.This world is in dire need ofrepair...and Death...indiscriminate...Are you prepared...To commit a cardinal sin?*\r\n- (Answering \"I'd like you to wait\")*Very well.Tell me, when you are fully prepared.*\r\n- (Answering \"I'm Ready\")*Very well.**Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.*(A cinematic of Melina igniting the forge)*O Erdtree, you shall burn.**Burn, for the sake of the new Lord.*(Turns back at you)*Thank you. For guiding me here.*(Lifts hand and ignites more intensly)*The one who walks alongside flame, **Shall one day meet the road of Destined Death.**Good-bye.*\r\nUpon resting at any Site of Grace after having inherited the Frenzied Flame\r\n- *You... have inherited the Frenzied Flame. A pity. You are no longer fit. Our journey together ends here. And remember... Should you rise as the Lord of Chaos, I will kill you, as sure as night follows day. Such is my duty, for allowing you the strength of runes. Goodbye, my companion. Goodbye, Torrent...*\r\n\"Lord of Frenzied Flame\" ending cutscene\r\n- *Lord of Frenzied Flame... I will seek you, as far as you may travel... To deliver you what is yours. Destined Death.*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Notes & Trivia for Melina\r\n- Her dagger, `Blade of Calling`, can be found by jumping off the elevator from Leyndell to the Forbidden Lands into an opening in the wall.\r\n- The description of her dagger refers to her as the \"kindling maiden\"\r\n- Melinas internal name in the game files is \"MaricaOfDaughter\". Her dialogue in the game already heavily hints at Marika being her mother.\r\n###  Melina Image Gallery\r\n\r\n \r\n"

Iron Fist Alexander is a large `Living Jar` who set out from his home one day in search of adventure, seeking to become a mighty warrior. He also becomes available as an `NPC Summon` cooperater where he can fight alongside players\r\n \r\n \r\n### Iron Fist Alexander Information in Elden Ring\r\nAlexander is first found stuck in the ground, asking for help. If you talk to him, he will kindly ask you to help him out. You can choose to either help him out or simply leave him there in the ground.\r\n- This NPC can be fought.\r\n- If defeated, drops: \n  \t- 1500 `Runes`\r\n\t- `Warrior Jar Shard` (if fought BEFORE       `Crumbling Farum Azula`)\r\n\t- `Shard of Alexander` (if fought at `Crumbling Farum Azula`)\r\n\t- `Alexander's Innards` (if fought at `Crumbling Farum Azula`)\r\n \r\n \r\n### Iron Fist Alexander Location in Elden Ring\r\n**Iron Fist Alexander** is found in multiple locations as the story progresses:\r\n1. Alexander can be found in Northern `Stormhill`, West to the river and North of the `Agheel Lake North Site of Grace`. [`Map Link `]\r\n1. He can next be found in `Gael Tunnel`. This tunnel is in the border, between `Caelid` and `Limgrave`. He can be found past a door, and once he is talked to he expresses his desire to move on to `Redmane Castle`. [`Elden Ring Interactive Map Link`] If the Radahn Festival has been triggered, Alexander will disappear and appear at `Redmane Castle`.\r\n1. Talk to him again at `Redmane Castle`, he will talk about his excitement about the incoming encounter with Radahn. [`Elden Ring Interactive Map Link`]\r\n1. He can then be summoned for the boss fight against `Starscourge Radahn`. If he has not been interacted with prior to this, he will show up at the festival anyway and introduce himself. Before moving to his next location, he can be found scavenging at `Starscourge Radahn's` Site of Grace. Here he must be talked to exhausting all dialogue to continue his questline. [`Elden Ring Interactive Map Link`]\r\n1. Found in `Liurnia of the Lakes`, just south of `Carian Study Hall`. Follow the path south from the `Artist's Shack` Site of Grace. Alexander will call out for help as the player gets closer to his location. He will ask you to make him \"slippery.\" Use an `Oil Pot` or `Roped Oil Pot` to free him. This step can be skipped by going to Mt. Gelmir after the Radahn festival. [`Elden Ring Interactive Map Link`]\r\n1. Found near the `Seethewater Terminus` Site of Grace at a lava lake south of `Fort Laiedd` in `Mt. Gelmir`. Alexander is sitting in the lake behind a `Magma Wyrm`. Alexander can be spoken to from the safety of the rock in the lava lake. Upon exhausting all of his dialogue, he will give the player the `Jar`.[`Elden Ring Interactive Map Link`]\r\n1.

Found in `Crumbling Farum Azula`. From the Dragon Temple Lift grace (can be accessed by using two Stonesword Keys), go past the plaza full of undead up the flight of stairs, turn right and you'll see two square bracket shaped archways. Jump on the archway on the left (closest to the sleeping dragon) to get over to the other side. Alexander can be found directly on the flat arena after crossing the crumbling tower. [`Elden Ring Interactive Map Link`] He will challenge you to a warrior's duel, and if you win, he will reward you with `Alexander's Innards` and `Shard of Alexander`. If you lose, he will continue letting you challenge him until you win.\r\n \r\n### Iron Fist Alexander Questline: How to complete Iron Fist Alexander's Quest\r\n- You can help Iron Fist Alexander out by hitting him a few times on the back with any weapon. While you hit him, he will express some pain, but then he'll tell you to keep trying. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n- You will eventually push him out, he will stand up and congratulate you, seeming to be okay. As he is pushed out of the ground, you will receive the `Triumphant Delight Gesture`. Alexander in turn rewards you with a piece of `Exalted Flesh` for your efforts and then hints at his next destination. He tells you of `Redmane Castle` in `Caelid` where a combat festival is taking place.\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Iron Fist Alexander\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Hello-o? Can you hear me?**Help me! I'm stuck.**Hello? Hellooo! Anyone! (repeating)*\r\n- *Oh my stars I'm so happy to see you!**I am Alexander, also known as the Iron Fist. And as you can see, I'm stock here.**Please, can you help me out of this?*\r\nChoosing \"Help him out\"\r\n- *My thanks! a thousand thanks! Just give me a good smack from the rear, with something nice and big.*\r\n- *Put those doubts to rest, I'll be just fine. I'm very well trained.**Give it your all, I say!*\r\nTalking again without helping\r\n- *Come on, give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big. I'll pop clean out. I'm sure of it!*\r\nChoosing \"Don't help\"\r\n- *I see. More's the pity. No, no, don't apologize. Despite my appearance, I am a chip off a greater jar. I'll pop out eventually, just you wait.*\r\nAfter \"Don't help\" and returning (female):\r\n- *Ahh, what's that look good lady? Are you willing to help me out after all?*\r\nAfter attacking him in Limgrave\r\n- *Ngh!*\r\n- *What are you playing at?*\r\n- *Wait, I see. I see it now. Humans all lose their wits, eventually.*\r\n- (On player kill)* A finer battle was never witnessed. How do you fancy joining the lads inside, eh?*\r\nKilling him at Limgrave\r\n- *How could this... Was my whole existence... just a crock?*\r\nUpon getting unstuck\r\n- *Ah!**Ouuch!**Ahhh!*\r\n- *\"Ahh! Well played good lady/sir. Well Played. **Though that mighty wallop of your almost spelt the end of me!Ha ha ha ha! Well, I'm out now, and that's what counts.I thank you, and as a token of my appreciation, I'd like you to have this\".*\r\n- *\"Once again, the pleasure is mine. I am the warrior jar known as Alexander. Iron Fist Alexander, in fact.**I journey to the east, where I intend to further my education in the ways of war.**Beyond these lands lie the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.**And upon their southern edge is Redmane Castle, in which a festival of combat is being held.**I'd heard whispers of such festivities before... Doesn't the notion set your breast aflutter!**Ha ha ha ha!\"*\r\n- *I'm heading eastward. To Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.**I've heard there's to be a festival held there.*\r\n Encounter at Rear `Gael Tunnel` Entrance, before unlocking door to Gael Tunnel\r\n- *Oh I hadn't expected to see your face again.Are you heading to the festival of combat, too?**Oh, no need to be coy with me.**Judging by the fine wallop you gave the old backside earlier, I would venture you're something of a warrior yourself.**The mere thought of such a festival gets the blood pumping, eh!**Now, now, according to my calculations, passing through this road should lead us to the Caelid Wilds.**But however you slice it, it seems we've reached a dead end.**I'm sorry to have raised your hopes.**It seems my calculations must have been off...*\r\n- *I was created to be a warrior vessel.**Many great warriors reside within me, ever dreaming of becoming a great champion.**It's my destiny. And the reason for which I quest.**It is my ordeal, you could say. To test myself, to better myself, to fell ever greater foes.**And then, one day, we'll be a single great champion. The greatest of them all!**What do you think, eh? How do you rate my changes?**Heh heh...*\r\nSecond encounter at `Gael Tunnel`, or if encountering after going through from Caelid side\r\n- *...!*\r\n- *The esteemed warrior. Where did you spring from? This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it. What's going on here? A door, from thin air! Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds. Gosh, that dead-end had me rather stumped! Heh...heh..*\r\n- *It's time I set off. To the festival al `Redmane Castle` on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds. Doesn't the thought just set your heart aflutter!*\r\nBefore fighting Radahn at Redmane Castle\r\n- *Ah, you came, how delightful! Indeed, I thought I might find you here.**By the by, do you know for whom this festival is being held? Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself!**To think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh...**In truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute. But! The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking!**Now, be sure to get a good vantage, my friend. I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.*\r\nAfter fighting Radahn at Redmane Castle\r\n- *A-ah, hello there. It was a battle marvellously fought. You are well and truly a champion, friend.**I, on the other hand, am nothing but a crock. One hit was all it took to crack me, and for my insides to come spilling out.**After that, I hid like a coward. And as such, I can hardly stand to face one such as you.*\r\n- *...But don't you think I've given up just yet. As luck would have it, there's a veritable mountain of warriors' bodies right here.**If I can just squeeze this bunch down inside me, I'll be a mighty warrior again in no time.**And you know... The bodies found here are exceedingly fine. **Who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars!**Just you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger! Just you wait, when next we meet! Heh heh...*\r\nAt Liurnia of the Lakes\r\n- *Ahh, hello! How nice it is to see a friendly face! As you can surmise, I've got myself stuck in another hole. Would you mind helping me out, again? *\r\n- (Help him) *My thanks in advance, I know you're the man for the job! You know what to do, hm?**Give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big.**Don't worry about my wound sustained at the festival. I'm stuck back together good and proper! Just give it your all!*\r\nReleasing him at Liurnia\r\n- *Nngh! Oh, yes! That's the ticket!*\r\n- *My thanks! To you and your razor-sharp wits. As a token of my thanks, I'd like you to have this.*\r\n- *Deary me, I'm oilier than a toad! There were countless oil jars back where I'm from actually.**And now I know what it's like to be one of them! Heh heh...*\r\n- *Yes, indeed, I too have a home. Though it is one to which I have vowed not to return.**So, I thought I might look out from atop the cliff, but as I drew closer and closer...**Pow! Wouldn't you know it, I was perfectly stuck in that blasted hole.**I can feel the warriors inside admonishing me for my mawkishness. To walk the path of champions, one cannot cleave to the past!**I'm headed to the fiery mount in the north. I can strengthen myself there, without fear of cracking this vessel.**I will forge myself anew in its flames!*\r\nAt Mt. Gelmir\r\n- *Ngh! Rnnngh! O mountain of fire! Bake me in your flames!*\r\n- *Nnngh! Ah, good lady/sir, what business might you have in such a place as this?**I hardly think you're here to temper yourself with flame, considering that flesh form of yours.**Your timing though, is impeccable as ever! I've been making just the thing for you on my journey here.**Take it, I'm sure it'll suit you to a tee.***\r\n- *But oh, it's hardly more than lukewarm here. I won't be able to temper my body such that it'll never crack again.**Perhaps I'll head eastward. There's an old saying I've caught wind of.**\"Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak doth soar, here lieth the flame of ruin, which ever burning roars.\"*\r\nAt Crumbling Farum Azula\r\n- *Ah, I see you've finally made it here yourself. The city hanging in the air is slowly crumbling. What an incredible place we find ourselves.**But that aside, you're certainly a force to be reckoned with, eh.**I doubt there's a single soul who could've handled that giant, other than you. It was practically a god...**Of course I count myself, the great Alexander, among the many. **Which means, I've but one thing to ask of you. Would you kindly undertake my ordeal?**Come and tell me when you're ready. I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you.*\r\n- *You are ready then, I take it? Then let us begin! I am the great jar warrior, Iron Fist Alexander! Lend me strength, O warriors within! Let us become one champion, together!*\r\nAfter winning the duel\r\n- *As I suspected... Victory... was impossible. This vessel... was found lacking...*\r\n- *My thanks, I knew you were the stuff of champions. It was a marvellous battle.**I implore you, take what I bequeath...from inside me... All vessels are destined to one day break.**But the great Alexander lived as a warrior to his last! Ha ha ha ha!*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Notes & Trivia for Iron Fist Alexander\r\n- Alexander speaks and sounds similar to Siegmeyer and Siegward of Catarina from Dark Souls and Dark Souls 3, though those 2 share a different voice actor than Alexander, therefore his character could possibly be a reference to the Catarina Knights of games past.\r\n- According to the Shard of Alexander, it would seem that Alexander had taken parts of a “red-haired champion” into himself, making him mightier than before. Radahn would easily fit this description, seeing as Alexander was busy scraping up bodies to fill himself once more, after fighting Radahn. It would be easy to assume that he had taken parts of Radahn and shoved it inside of him.\r\n- He is an available `NPC Summon` against `Starscourge Radahn` during the Radahn festival and can also be summoned against the `Fire Giant`. For his conditions,  Progress in his questline and he will be available as a summon. Make sure he is not stuck in his first location or stuck South of the `Carian Study Hall` in Liurnia. His summon sign will be at the fog gate entrance close to the Site of Grace before facing the Fire Giant.\r\n \r\n \r\n"

And it's as fearsome as it it majestic. **So, unless you're mad, or wish to be burned alive...**Stay clear of the lake.*\r\n- *Don't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late.*\r\nDuring Bloody Finger Nerijus invasion\r\n- *If it isn't Nerijus, The Bloody Finger. The end is nigh. For you, and your cessblood.*\r\nAfter Bloody Finger Nerijus invasion\r\n- *Ah, we meet again. To have fought Nerijus and lived, you must have seen your share of battle. I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers. Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own. If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them. Just remember, no kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it. Don't let your emotions stay your blade.*\r\nIntroduction if not spoken to before Bloody Finger Nerijus Invasion\r\n- *Just joining the fray, Tarnished?Well, you fought Nerijus and survived. That alone deserves commendation.I am Yura. Hunter of Bloody Fingers.Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own. If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.Just remember. No Kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.Don't let your emotions stay your blade.*\r\n- *One last word of warning.Stay clear of Agheel Lake. A great dragon roosts there.And it's as fearsome as it is majestic.So, unless you're mad, or wish to be burned alive...stay clear of the lake.*\r\n- *Be on your way.**Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits.*\r\nAfter dying to Agheel Lake Dragon, and returning to the Seaside Ruins location\r\n- *You bloody halfwit. Picking a fight with a dragon? Well, I can tell you want to see it through. Seems I'm forever crossing paths with hotheads like you. *\r\n- *I can tell you want to see it through. Fools will be fools. Fight all the dragons you like.*\r\nAfter killing Agheel Lake Dragon, and returning to the Seaside Ruins location\r\n- *Beautiful work, felling that dragon. And as such there's something you might like to know. That heart you brought back, its used in Dragon Communion. If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength, then seek the decrepit church, on the little island off the western coast.*\r\n- *You must not forget though. Those who partake in Dragon Communion will one day shed their humanity. Their hunger for dragon, their yearning, only worsens. Until the floodgates burst, unleashing eternal torment. The strength of a mighty dragon. Magnificent, but deadly. Its no surprise that Dragon Communion is ruinous.*\r\nOther\r\n- *Be on your way. Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits.*\r\nAfter invading Bloody Finger Ravenmount Assassin\r\n- *Wretched worms, leave me be...*\r\n- *Ah, oh, it's you. Thanks for your help there.**That Bloody Finger was a thorn in my side. And now I'm finally rid of him.**Here's a token of thanks. Please take it.*\r\n- *I may not have much time.**I'm dying to see you, Eleonora... Violet Bloody Finger...*\r\n- *Yes, I've been tracking Eleonora for quite some time.**She is the deadliest of all the Bloody Fingers. She's felled many an old hand already.**But in spite of her cessblood zealotry, Eleonora is a proud knight.**If she comes for you, do not think twice. You must flee.**There is no shame in self preservation.*\r\nAt the Second Church of Marika\r\n- *Eleonora, it seems I am no match for you.**But I've learned a thing or two myself, you see.**I've sliced the finger off.**Please, please, Eleonora, yield to the cessblood no longer.**Do not stain the immaculacy of your sword, your flesh, your fire...*\r\nAfter being attacked\r\n- (Combat)* Too late for you, eh? Well, if you've succumbed to cessblood... it's better that I finish you here.*\r\n- (On player kill)* I had no choice. Your death could have been much worse.*\r\nUpon defeat\r\n- *I must not die...until she is eradicated.*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Notes & Trivia for Bloody Finger Hunter Yura\r\n- In combat, Yura wields a `Nagikiba`. When fighting him after he is possessed by Shabriri, he moves his sword to his left hand, and now has a `Frenzied Flame Seal`, using it to cast `Unendurable Frenzy`, `Inescapable Frenzy`, and `Howl of Shabriri` (insert other spells)\r\n- Eleonora appears to have taken part in Dragon Communion based on her armor and spells used during the invasion. This explains how Yura knows about Dragon Communion and how it works, as well as the dangers of it. \r\n \r\n \r\n"

    "mainContent": "**White Mask Varré** is an `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. **White Mask Varré** is encountered near the start of the game, right by The First Step `Site of Grace`, and will offer advice to the player. He can be found multiple times in different locations as the story progresses.\r\n \r\n \r\n### White Mask Varré Location in Elden Ring\r\nWhite Mask Varré can be found in various locations throughout your adventure:\r\n1. He will be the very first NPC you speak to at the beginning of the game. Found in `Limgrave`, by The First Step `Site of Grace`. `Map Link`.\r\n1. After defeating `Godrick the Grafted`, or obtaining any of the `Great Runes`, going back and talking to him, and visiting the `Roundtable Hold` for the first time, White Mask Varré can be found at `Rose Church`, in a large island southwest of `Liurnia`. `Map Link`.\r\n \r\n- This NPC moves to different locations\r\n- This NPC can be fought\r\n- If defeated, drops: \n  \t- 500 `Runes` \r\n\t- 6 `Festering Bloody Finger`\r\n \r\n- If defeated in Mohgwyn Dynasty by invading him, drops: \n  \t- 1 `Furcalling Finger Remedy`\r\n\t- 1 `Rune Arc`\r\n\t- 6 `Festering Bloody Fingers`, `Varre's Bouquet` (Return to invasion sign, and talk to him, after returning to your world.)\r\n \r\n### White Mask Varré Questline: How to complete White Mask Varré's Quest\r\n- Awards you the `Festering Bloody Finger` upon meeting him the second time at `Rose Church`. \r\n- Upon invading players using the Finger three times (note: using `Recusant Finger` will NOT work), he'll ask you to join his order with the Bloody Lord. If you agree, he will give you the `Lord of Blood's Favor` item, requesting you soak it in the blood of a maiden. \n  \t- The closest will be a Maiden corpse in the `Church of Inhibition`, north east of Liurnia.\r\n\t- Possible is also the corpse at `Chapel of Anticipation` if you've unlocked the second belfry at the `The Four Belfries`.\r\n\t- You can also kill `Irina`, which is the easiest to reach when she is at the entrance of the `weeping peninsula`.\r\n \r\n- Once you return with the blood-soaked Favor, he rewards with a reusable `Bloody Finger`. If you speak with him again, you will receive the `Pureblood Knight's Medal` that can lead to Mohgwyn's palace where you can fight `Mohg, Lord of Blood`. This is the earliest access to Mohg boss fight. \r\n- An invasion sign can be found near the `Mausoleum Dynasty Midpoint` site of grace allowing you to fight White Mask Varré\r\n- **Note:**\t- If killed he cannot be respawned at church of Vows therefore making his questline incompletable, although you can still reach Mohgwyn's palace with a hidden teleporter North-West of the Yelough Anix Tunnel\r\n \r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: White Mask Varré\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Oh yes... Tarnished, are we? Come to the Lands Between for the Elden Ring, hmm?Of course you have. No shame in it.Unfortunately for you, however, you are maidenless.Without guidance, without the strength of runes, and without an invitation to the Roundtable Hold...You are fated, it seems, to die in obscurity.*\r\n- *Luckily for you, however, there is one shining ray of hope for even the maidenless.Me. Varré. Take care to listen.Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished.You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times.That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel.Mm, indeed. Grace's guidance holds the answers.It will lead you Tarnished to the path you are meant to follow.Even if it leads you to your grave.*\r\n- *Grace's guidance will reveal the path forward, most certainly.To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff.The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted.*\r\n- *It's time you set off, I should think.To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff, where grace would guide you.If you seek the Elden Ring, maidenless as you are.*\r\nIf attacked\r\n- *Oh?*\r\n- *Do you even comprehend the gravity of this choice?*\r\n- *Very well. If you mistake kindness for frailty of heart, then perhaps a more physical lesson is in order!*\r\n- (On player kill)* You will die nameless, without ceremony.*\r\nVisit\r\n- *What's the matter? Shouldn't you be off proving yourself, or some such? Then go on, take the hint and follow the guidance of grace. To castle Stormveil, on the cliff. And if, by chance you do find your way to the castle, you may receive a summons. To the famed Roundtable Keep...*\r\nAfter defeating `Margit, The Fell Omen` and accessing to `Roundtable Hold`\r\n- *Ohh, well done, well done indeed. You made it through that entire mess, all the way to Stormveil.**And off you trotted to the Roundtable Hold... My sincerest congratulations.**But, how did you find the Roundtable? Oh, you don't have to say it.Before, the Roundtable was chock full of venerated warriors, but now, it's home to puff-chests and has-beens.I fear you've been terribly disappointed. I don't blame you.But still, the Roundtable has its perks. Why not earn a seat?Fly straight and true, so to speak.*\r\nChoosing* \"I'll fly straight and true!\"*\r\n- * Ahh, then you're interested? A wise choice indeed.To join the Roundtable proper, you must acquire a Great Rune,and request audience... with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.They are the purported masters of the grace that guides your kind, the Tarnished.Mm, yes, pay them a visit, so that you may see for yourself.*\r\n- *Challenge Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil, to acquire a Great Rune.Decrepit, he may be, but a demigod he remains. And of course, an inheritor of a Great Rune.Worse yet, I hear old Godrick's acquired a ferocious new toy to graft...So. Prepare for the worst.*\r\nChoosing *\"I don't need a seat\"*\r\n- *... Yes, I see. Perhaps it's just as well. Besides, you are maidenless. One can only do so much with the materials provided. But then again, if you should realize the error of your ways, I'm always willing to hear you out.*\r\nTalking again, after choosing \"*I don't need a seat*\"\r\n- *Oh, have you decided to have a go after all? At joining the round table proper?*\r\nVisit after \r\n- *What's the matter? Aren't you supposed to be earning your place at the Roundtable Hold?**Then you must face Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil,for without a Great Rune,**you will not be granted audience. With the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.*\r\nVisit after killing Godrick\r\n- *Ah, there you are. You claimed a Great Rune, and had your audience. With the Two Fingers, at the Roundtable Hold. What was your impression? *\r\nChoosing \"They didn't seem right\"\r\n- *Ah-ha, your intuition serves you well. My doubts had been piling up, you see... The words of the Two Fingers cannot be trusted. Truly, naught but rambling, senile delusions. I believe, that when the Elden Ring was shattered, the Two Fingers were corrupted, their guidance; skewed. Even worse, the Fingers harbor no love for our kind. That's the part that irks the most.*\r\nChoosing \"They were magnificent\"\r\n- *You don't say. Well, what a relief that must be. You may go, then. My work here is done. May the wisdom of the two fingers guide you.*\r\nReceiving the Fingers\r\n- *Oh, I have a gift for you, something fit for only the wise. A means for circumventing the draw of the Two Fingers. Give it a try, won't you? And if it please you, may we meet again. I've high hopes for you. My lambkin. Be sure to try that finger I gave you. There's no reason to dither. *\r\nVisit at the Rose Church, after using the Finger three times.\r\n- *Oh, lambkin, so pleased you're here. I'm glad you're enjoying my gift. Mmm, I knew from the very start. You have a taste for noble blood. *\r\n- *I wish to anoint you a proper inductee. A knight to serve Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, and establish a new dynasty. Luminary Mohg has strength, vision, and of course, love. So, what do you say, my lambkin? *\r\nChoosing *\"Anoint me.\"*\r\n- *Mm, yes, who would have it any other way? Now, take this. For your final trial. Soak the cloth with a maiden's blood. Normally, this ritual would involve killing one's own maiden, and recanting the wisdom of the Two Fingers. But since you are maidenless, the blood of anyone's maiden will do.*\r\nChoosing \"*Refuse.*\"\r\n- *Oh my. Perhaps you misheard me. Nothing wrong with giving you a day or two. For your ears to clear out.*\r\nAfter returning with the blood-soaked Favor.\r\n- *Ahh, my lambkin. You've completed your final trial. And with this, you are a formal inductee. A knight who will assist Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, in the establishment of a new dynasty. Now, give me your finger. This noble blood will be an immutable badge of honor, once it settles. Inside of you. *\r\n- *Oh, good heavens. Clench your teeth, or something.*\r\n- *Never forget that feeling of agony. For it is what binds you to Luminary Mogh, to all of us. Ha ha ha... You have the sweetest scream. My lambkin.*\r\nUpon invading him near the Mausoleum Dynasty Midpoint grace.\r\n- *You seek violence, heedless of my warning, though you have been raised to a knight of the dynasty? I am pained, to the very depths of my being. I'll ensure you regret this, my lambkin. Enjoy your miserable death.*\r\n  Death.\r\n- You maidenless runt... Who do you think I am?  <Groan>\r\nWhen killed while invading him.\r\n- *Why must I be... disgraced by this lowborn*\r\nFinal dialogue when talked to after invading him\r\n- *O... Luminary... Mohg...**Please grant... the strength... you promised**I have given... everything...**Please... my lord...*\r\n- *Please, answer me... Luminary... Mohg.**...**A-ahh...**Bless the Mohgwyn Dynasty, with love!*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Notes & Trivia for White Mask Varré\r\n- During combat, Varre uses `Varre's Bouquet` and a sacred seal, which he uses to cast `Catch Flame`, `Bloodflame Blade`, and `Swarm of Flies`\r\n- He used to tell you to go die in a ditch. This was only said during the network test, and was removed from the final release of the game.\r\n        \"*Feel free to go off and die in a ditch somewhere.\"*\r\n- Cannot be revived at Church of Vow\r\n- May have been involved in the death of the maiden at the chapel of anticipation, which could have been the player's maiden - he is waiting for you right outside where you start, immediately knows you are maidenless, and has a quest about killing maidens\r\n- He wears the `War Surgeon Set`, which drops from one of the three `Nameless White Mask` invaders in `Mohgwyn Dynasty Mausoleum`.\r\n- The War Surgeon Set's description implies that Mohg originally had the surgeons abducted against their will; Varré included. It details that none of the other White Masks Mohg had taken were able to \"tame the accursed blood\", but that Varré was the exception. This could be related to Varré's apparent deep loyalty to Mohg.\r\n###  White Mask Varré Image Gallery\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"

Her embrace will give you a special consumable that can increase poise called the Baldachin's Blessing. You can ostensibly come back for more if you happen to run out of this consumable.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Fia Location in Elden Ring\r\nFia can be found at the `Roundtable Hold` and later again after defeating `Fia's Champions` in `Deeproot Depths`.\r\n- This NPC moves\r\n- This merchant can't be fought\r\n- Grants `Baldachin's Blessing` if you allow her to hold you. Decreases your max. HP by 5% for as long as you keep it in your inventory. After consuming it and its effect ending, you will regain your full HP.\t- She grants you **Baldachin's Blessing** infinitely as long as you don't have one currently in your inventory.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Fia Questline: How to complete Fia's Quest \r\n- After resting at a Site of Grace in `Altus Plateau`, you can return to Fia and embrace her to gain an additional line of dialogue during which she will hand you a `Weathered Dagger`. Talking to `D, Hunter of the Dead` in the Roundtable Hold will allow you to give the knife to him, triggering the next part of the quest.\r\n- Defeating a second Shardbearer and claiming their great rune will trigger a second secret dialogue in which she hands you a simple map concerning the location of a `Black Knifeprint`.\r\n- Reloading the area after this part will trigger an event where you'll find Fia in a newly opened room near the blacksmith, after which she'll disappear.\r\n- You will then need to head to the tallest part of `Deeproot Depths`, up the tree branches near Godwyn's corpse offshoot. After a boss fight, you may find her sitting in the back of the arena. Upon talking to her, telling her that you want to be hugged will trigger the next step of her quest, asking you to find the `Cursemark of Death`, that you get while going through Ranni's quest. ***[`Map Link`]***\t- **Note that a big chunk of her questline can be skipped, if one so desires (main Quest spoilers ahead!):**Once the player progressed through the main events of the game up to the point of burning the Erdtree, Fia will relocate to the `Deeproot Depths` even if the player never interacted with her. This way, all of the steps mentioned above are skipped.\r\n\t- If the player chooses to use this method, they will still find `D, Hunter of the Dead`'s corpse on the ground where he is normally found, but Fia will not stand above it and then vanish since she already left the `Roundtable Hold`.\r\n \r\n- Bringing back the Cursemark of Death will nearly end her quest. After you give it to her, she will give the player a `Radiant Baldachin's Blessing`. Exhaust her dialog and upon reloading the area, she'll be asleep. Inspecting her will let you enter the Deathbed Dream to fight `Lichdragon Fortissax`.\r\n- Winning this fight will allow you to pick up the `Mending Rune of the Death-Prince`, which will in turn allow you to obtain an alternate `ending`.\r\n- After acquiring the rune, you can give the Twinned armor set to D's brother (NPC sitting on the floor past the corridor to the south east of the `Valiant Gargoyle` boss' grace site \"Great Waterfall Basin\"). Upon returning to Fia, you will find `Fia's Set` next to her, and if you reload the area, D's brother will leave behind the `Twinned Set` you gave him, as well as the `Inseparable Sword`. Killing D's brother will also get you the armor set and the sword.\r\n- You can prevent this scene by killing D in his first location, getting his armor, and giving it to his brother early. After reloading the area he can be fought.\r\n \r\nRelated NPCs:\r\n- `Rogier`\r\n- \r\n- \r\n- `Ranni `\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Fia\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Greetings, great champion called by grace. **I am Fia.**Circumstances have compelled my stay at the Roundtable Hold.**Great champion, would you allow me to hold you, but briefly?**Perhaps you might share with me some of your lifely vigour, and your stout-heartedness.**Doing so will grant me the warmth of a champion. **And you, I am sure, will bear a baldachin's blessing.**Do you think it vulgar, perhaps? **Where I come from, it is a sacred act.*\r\nLetting her hold you\r\n- *\"Ah, my thanks, great champion. **You are...very warm...\"**\"What you felt light up inside you was a baldachin's blessing. **Though it is but a fleeting thing, I am afraid.**Come back to me, should you require another. **I will take you in my arms as often as you need\".*\r\nTalk in secret\r\n- *I was known as a Deathbed Companion, where I come from. Afer I recieved the warmth and lifely vigour from a number o champions,**I lay with the remains of an exalted noble, to grant him another chance at life. To do so is the purpose of me being.**But before I could bear the noble into new life, I was awakened by the guidance of grace, and chased from my birthplace.**Pray, be kind. Despite all that, I still wish to be Deathbed Companion.**So please, let me hold you like this, as often as it takes.*\r\nAbout the Black Knifeprint (Do you know...?)\r\n- *My dear... Have you ever heard of black knifeprints? Dear Rogier likes to talk of it when abed.**The ancient plot, in which the first of the Demigods was slain. The black knifes wielded by the assassins who committed the act,**along with the impressions they made, somehow hide the truth of the conspiracy.

He seemed positively elated.**He must be possessed of great mental fortitude. It anchors his will, and sustains him, despite his grievous wounds.**You truly are a champion. To dear Rogier, and myself, too.* (recieves: `Scrificial Twig` x1)\r\nOther\r\n- (May I ask a favor?) My dear? Might I ask something of you? Could you please find the owner of this dagger, and return it to them? [Receive `Weathered Dagger`] A certain person gave it to me as a gift. It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart. So I would like for the owner to have it back, if you wouldn't mind.\r\n- (Upon D's death) Finally, it is returned to its rightful place. The stolen hallowbrand, of the exalted noble. And now, I must bid you goodbye as well. Though I ask you deliver this message to the Roundtable Hold. I am Fia, Deathbed Companion. Hark, Roundtable.

Descend the ladder or simply jump down below to another section of the ramparts where some knights are fighting the Misbegotten.\r\n\t- Head straight toward the fight, past the gallows, and climb the set of stairs circling up to the next corner of the castle. Edgar will be sitting alone on a bench.\r\n \r\n- Edgar may move to the `Bridge of Sacrifice`, to `Irina's  `location, as part of her questline. `Map Link`.\r\n- This NPC can be fought\r\n- If defeated, drops: \n  \t- Banished Knight's Halberd +8\r\n\t- 1000 Runes\r\n\t- `Shabriri Grape` (Whatever area he died in must be reloaded - the grape will appear where you usually find him in that area).\r\n \r\n- Even after completing Edgar's questline, he will invade your world when visiting the Revenger Shack in `Liurnia`.\r\n \r\n### Edgar Questline: How to complete Edgar's Quest\r\nEdgar's quest is part of  `Irina's` questline. Speak to Irina near the first site of grace of `Weeping Peninsula`, and she will ask you to help deliver a letter, \"`Irina's Letter`\", to her father in `Castle Morne`, at the southern tip of the `Weeping Peninsula`.\r\n- After successfully delivering her letter to `Edgar`, he will lament that he is not able to go to Irina because of his ongoing duties at Castle Morne - he cannot allow the `Grafted Blade Greatsword` to be stolen by the Misbegotten.\t- Upon delivering the letter to Edgar, return to Irina to find an `Iron Cleaver` embedded in the ground next to her.\r\n\t- Killing `Edgar` will progress the questline in the same way.\r\n \r\n- After defeating `Leonine Misbegotten` and retrieving the sword, Edgar will thank the player and return to Irina.\r\n- `Edgar  `can then be found next to Irina. Talk to him to progress the questline.\r\n- If the player travels to the `Revenger's Shack`, `Edgar` will appear as a hostile invader in the form of `Edgar the Revenger`.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Edgar\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Ah, there's a face I've not seen before. I'm Edgar, warden of this castle as ordained by Lord Godrick himself. But you can see how things have turned out. The menials have all rebelled. They gave me good service, or so I thought, but it seems it was all an act. Foul creatures, as it's said. And true enough they're foul inside and out. I'm sorry to disappoint you, But whatever you've come here to do, I'm afraid Castle Morne won't hold much longer. Take this, by way of apology.*\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- *Ugh! I haven't a clue what's got into you, but as Lord of this castle, I will stand for it no longer!*\r\n- *Ah, now I see! You had a hand in Irina's undoing! What could she have done to deserve that?*\r\n- (On player kill) *And now even your ilk have complicated matters.*\r\nDeath\r\n- *Please forgive me, Lord Godrick.*\r\n- *Forgive me, Irina... I will join you soon enough.*\r\nWhen giving Irina's Letter\r\n- *I see, from Irina... Thank you. I'm in your debt. But I can't leave yet. Even if the castle should fall, as commander, I must remain. To ensure the treasured sword of Morne does not fall into the wrong hands.*\r\n- *If you see Irina, do tell her. That her father will come for her, once he's fulfilled his duty.*\r\nOn Retrieving the Sword\r\n- *\"I'm in your debt. I'm no longer bound by duty. Once I've rescued Irina, I will spend my remaining days with her. Thanks to you, I will be reunited with Irina. And devote my remaining days to her. Irina has a gentle nature, though. I only hope it remains intact.\"*\r\nOn Seeing Irina's Death\r\n- *\"Irina...How could this be...My daughter deserved better...The fault lies...with me. I chose duty over my daughter's safety. And that is how fate has answered...I'll find them. The foul wretches responsible for this. I'll hunt them down, and exterminate every last one of them. Rest assured, Irina. It will be done.\"*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Edgar Notes & Trivia\r\n- During combat, Edgar uses a `Banished Knight's Halberd` with the `Spinning Strikes` Ash of War, and a sacred seal, which he uses to cast `Golden Vow`\r\n \r\n \r\n"

I just want him to be safe...*\r\n*If attacked*\r\n- *Agh! Ah, why on earth? I do not wish to cause anyone harm.*\r\n- (On player kill)* Oh, bless the stars.

Please, be safe...*\r\nIf accepting to deliver the letter\r\n- Thank you, dearly.Then please, take this.Deliver it to my father, who remains in the castle, if you please.\r\n- Please, if you wouldn't mind. Deliver the letter to my father at the castle.He can be stubborn, but I'm sure he'll come around.\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Irina Notes & Trivia\r\n- Near **Irina**, on the way to `Castle Morne`, lies a Hearse ambushed by the `Misbegotten`. These are, presumably, what is left of Irina's escort. \n  \t- In that Hearse you can find the `Morning Star` mace.\r\n \r\n- At `Revenger's Shack`, `Edgar` appears as a hostile invader in the form of `Edgar the Revenger`, with the shack covered in dead bodies and `Raw Meat Dumplings`. The bodies don't appear to be `Misbegotten`, who Edgar swore to slay every last one of, so it is unknown why they were targeted instead.\r\n- Irina's appearance and blindness is similar to that of the `Hyetta`. Her father, Edgar, also drops a `Shabriri Grape` upon death, which are the items that Hyetta must eat to continue on her path to becoming a finger maiden. Possibly, like Hyetta, Irina was meant to become a finger maiden. It is unclear whether the Shabriri Grape that Edgar drops was something he was simply holding, intended to be given to Irina, or is literally his eyeball. \n  \t- It may be possible that after Irina's death, her body was taken over by Hyetta, just like `Yura's` body was taken over by `Shabriri`, after his demise. However, even after meeting Hyetta, Irina's body remains where it is.\r\n \r\n- \"Irina of Morne\" is a clear reference to Dark Souls 3 as both her and Irina of Carim are blind, and Eygon, a character close to Irina, wears the Morne's Armor set.\r\n \r\n \r\n"

A Knight commander from Stormveil took it. A fool, and plumb mad to boot. Simply obsessed with blood!\".*\r\nRecommendation\r\n- *\"Hmph, yes, now allow me to furnish you with a little advice. I would take great care to avoid Godrick's Tarnished hunts, were I in your shoes. That depraved lot are obsessed with sacrificing Tarnished like you for the sake of \"grafting. Honestly, Godrick's nothing more than a jumped up country bumpkin. Lord? Don't make me laugh.\".*\r\nSmall Talk\r\n- *\"What are you waiting for? A kiss goodbye? My fort lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. Take it back for me. Oh I see. You wish to know the reward? Fret not, the great Kenneth Haight is known for his considerable largesse. The celebrations will be lavish indeed, upon the dawn of my fort's retrieval\".*\r\nOn Godrick\r\n- *\"Honestly, Godrick’s no more than a jumped up country bumpkin. Lord? Don’t make me laugh. First he hid himself amongst the womenfolk to flee the capital, then hid from Radahn in that castle... Then he insulted Malenia, lost to her in battle, only to lick her boots rather than die like a man. Has he no shame, the big girl’s blouse? And to think, he’s the blood of Godfrey! Last of the golden lineage, though you almost wouldn’t know it to look at him. I almost feel sorry for the chap the more I think of it.\"*\r\nFort Haight Already Completed\r\n- *\"Hm? What's this, kind sir? Remarkable! The Knight Commander, dead. Already! A blessing, if ever I chanced upon one. Fine work, I say, fine work, indeed. I doubt that it was your intention, but the deed is done, and I commend you. Now, this is your reward. Go on, it is yours for the keeping.\"*\r\n- *\"Right then. Time for me to head to the fort. I've much to do. First I'll have to reestablish communication with the demi-humans. What's that look? You don't believe me? Well, under the Erdtree, commingling with the demi-humans is made possible. Even the vulgar shall not be left behind, under the rule of true Order. Which is why I, Kenneth Haight, next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave, have sworn to uphold it. Just you watch, my friend. Just you watch.\"*\r\nOffer to Serve\r\n- *\"Ah, yes. I've been meaning to ask. Would you like to enter my service? I see bright things in your future, stout warrior. Enter into my service and learn the workings of the Erdtree's true Order. And who knows, perhaps some time down the line, the grace of gold will return to those Tarnished eyes of yours. What say you? A fine accord, is it not?\"*\r\n- *\"Very well. Very well, indeed. I knew I saw something in you. I shall await you at my fort. We shall hold the ceremony for your knighting there, I think. I see great things ahead of us. We are truly by the Erdtree blessed.\"*\r\nAt Fort Haight\r\n- *\"Ah, you, is it? I suppose you must have seen by now, yes, the sorry state of my fort? Oh, indeed, it is a foul fate for a land, to be without a ruler. One must be found, with haste. And not that Awful Godrick. But a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave. I am sorry for have lifted your hopes... But I haven't the authority to raise you to the knighthood as things stand. The Great Kenneth Haight issues his sincerest apology. But now, I must begin my search post-haste. For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave.\"*\r\nAt Stormveil Castle throne room (after Nepheli Loux has been given Stormhawk King)\r\n- *Ah, nice to see you after so long. Safe and sound, I take it, yes? Good. Ah, quite. I have indeed selected a new ruler. Lady Nepheli is strong and just. Worthy of the burden of Limgrave's lineage. Such is the sincere opinion of I, Kenneth Haight, no less. For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards. At which time I can fulfil my old promise. By raising you to the glory of knighthood. I hope it is just as wonderful as you imagine.*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Kenneth Haight Notes & Trivia\r\n- Drops a `Golden Seed` upon defeat.\r\n- Mentions re-establishing communication with the demi-humans.

Do they think me a fool?You might be surprised to learn I took them up on the offer.Then I only had to ask. The location of the recusant hideout.It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west from the town of windmills.That's where they hide. The manor on the peak.Just you wait, wretched recusants.You'll rue the day you insulted my name by laying hands on Lanya.\"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood\" after all.*\r\nAt Volcano Manor\r\n- *Ah. Oh... I-it's you is it? Well. Nice to see you again.So you've been invited as well, I see.Then we're comrades in arms, henceforth. You watch my back, and I'll watch yours, yes?*\r\n- *I, um... I can tell... You're wondering about Lanya... Well, you see, I...After much internal debate. I've come to realise... Revenge is not the answerAccording to Lady Tanith... I've got the stuff of champions.And champions, ironic as it is, are oft forced walk a tainted a path.It hit me like a bolt from the blue... That my former thoughts were simple naiveté.Of course, my heart weeps for Lanya. That unfortunate incident was a cruel twist of fate indeed.But succumbing to the pain and sadness caused won't make me a champion, will it.Lanya knows this, I'm certain. Fate has laid hard roads for us both.But such is true of any road trod by champions.*\r\n- *I always resented these hands.Their pale complexion, a far cry from any warrior's. The shame of House Hoslow.But that won't be the case for long.They'll be darkened by grit, once I've set out on the path of champions.\"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood\" after all.*\r\nAfter doing the Volcano Manor questline\r\n- *It's just as my noble brother says. I'm a complete fool. I can't believe I thought I could become a champion.*\r\n- *Ah, it's you is it. I'm terribly sorry, but would you mind giving me some time to myself.I haven't achieved anything at all thus far. Even though I've dirtied my hands time and time again.I'm still yet to achieve anything. Perhaps I am a fool after all...No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the path of revenge and sullied the name of my house.What an easy mark I must have been... How did it take me so long to realise, honestly.There's just no end to my foolishness, is there...*\r\nJarburg\r\n- (Overheard talking to NPC jar) *Well. Aren't you full of beans. No wonder you're covered in muck.*\r\n- *Oh? My friend, it's been far too long. I have to say you caught me at a rather low point. But... as you can see, I've put all that behind me. Left the Volcano Manoor. Forging my own path now. Making my own choices. Even a fool like me can look after some simply jars. Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time in my life I'm on the straight and narrow.*\r\nAfter reloading Jarburg\r\n- *...Ah, you... Are the jars... they alright? Did I defend them?*\r\n- (If player responds, \"You defended them\") *Then all is well... This fool proved his worth, in the end...*\r\n- (If player responds, \"I'm afraid not\") *Ha ha...ha... I see... I see... I've been a fool... to the last...*\r\nWhen attacked at Academy Gate Town\r\n- (Warning) *Agh! What on earth was that for?*\r\n- (Combat) *Now I see. You're a wretched recusant! May you rue the day that you thought to trample me! The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood! In blood!*\r\n- (On player kill)* Lanya, your honour has been restored. You can rest easy.*\r\n*When attacked at Jarburg*\r\n- (Warning)* Ugh! What's the matter? Please, stop! I've no quarrel with the Volcano Manor.

    "mainContent": "**Patches** is a `Merchant`, `NPC` and `Boss` in **Elden Ring**. **Patches** is a recurring character in From Software games, usually playing the part of a liar or betrayer. He can be found in `Murkwater Cave`. This is an optional boss as players do not need to defeat him to advance.\r\nDuring combat, when **Patches** reaches low health, he will offer to surrender. If the surrender is accepted, he will open up a shop in Murkwater Cave. He also appears as an `NPC Summon` against `Starscourge Radahn`.\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Patches Boss\r\nPatches is a **Field Boss** found in `Murkwater Cave`. \r\n- Optional Boss\r\n- Field Boss\r\n- Closest Site of Grace: Murkwater Cave\r\n- Multiplayer allowed for this Boss\r\n- Can't summon Spirit ashes for this boss\r\n \r\n### Patches' Location in Elden Ring\r\n1. **Patches** can be found at the end of `Murkwater Cave`, past the `Highwayman` bandits. You have to open the chest to trigger the fight. [`Map Here`]\r\n1. **Patches** will surrender after approximately a quarter to half of his health is left. Stop attacking him to accept his surrender. If you repeatedly attack him while he is trying to surrender, he will become aggressive again.\r\n1. If you speak to Patches after accepting his surrender, he will ask if you forgive him. Your choice only affects what he says in response, he will become friendly regardless.\r\n1. After accepting his surrender, attacking him three times will cause him to become aggressive again. If you allow him to reduce your HP to a low amount, he will offer to accept your surrender if you grovel. Upon performing the Grovel for Mercy gesture and completing his dialog, you will automatically learn the **Extreme Repentance** gesture. If you perform the **Extreme Repentance** gesture before he kills you, he will accept your surrender and become friendly again.\r\n1. Whether you forgive him or not, **Patches** invites you to return, and you may find him in his lair at `Murkwater Cave`. There is a new chest there, which you can ask him about. Opening the chest will reveal a trap set up by **Patches**, one which teleports you to `Mistwood Ruins`.\r\n1. If you have already joined `Volcano Manor` at this point then you will skip the next couple locations and pick up the quest at the manor.\r\n1. If forgiven, **Patches** will leave `Murkwater Cave` and set up camp at the Scenic Isle `Site of Grace`, which is a raised isle in the southern parts of `Liurnia's` swamp, north of `Limgrave`. [`Map Here`] \n  - At his `Liurnia` location, he will recommend the player allow themselves to be captured by a `Virgin Abductor` with unique transpositional powers, saying it will transport them to the base of the Erdtree. The `Virgin Abductor` is located at the base of the waterwheel in the middle of the `Raya Lucaria Academy` dungeon. However, in true **Patches** fashion, the `Virgin Abductor` instead teleports the player to the fiery inquisition chambers of `Volcano Manor`, with the escape blocked until resting at a Site of Grace. Ironically, this does put the player closer to their goal, as it is one possible method of reaching `Altus Plateau`. \r\n- After setting foot in `Mt. Gelmir`, **Patches** will move to his next location. Uncertain if going to `Altus Plateau` is enough for him to relocate to the next location.\r\n \r\n1. He can be found hiding at `Mt. Gelmir`, close to the cliff west of the First Mt. Gelmir Campsite grace. There, he left a message on the ground, as well as a trail of colorful `Rainbow Stones` to lure the player to the edge of the cliff. When speaking with him, he just says that he's doing nothing suspicious at all. Upon following his trail of Rainbow Stones to the edge of the cliff, a cutscene will trigger in which **Patches** will push you down the cliff, saying that you'll never reach `Volcano Manor`. To be more precise about his location: go from the message (the message is right behind the `Mad Pumpkin Head`) to the first red glowing stone, then to the second glowing stone. Jump down (but not down the cliff!) in the direction of the third glowing stone and look southeast; **Patches** should now be in view. [`Map Link`]\r\n1. You can then find **Patches** inside `Volcano Manor`, in the hallway north of the Site of Grace.\r\n1. When in `Volcano Manor`, **Patches** has a questline. After completing one of `Tanith's` assassination requests, you can speak to him to receive the `Letter to Patches`. When you return to him after assassinating the target, he will mention reporting to Tanith about the assignment. Come back to talk to him after reloading the area, and he'll begrudgingly reward you with the `Magma Whip Candlestick`.\r\n1. **Patches** will leave `Volcano Manor` after killing the area boss `God-Devouring Serpent`.\r\n1. You can then find him at the `Shaded Castle` before the boss and he gives you `Dancer's Castanets`.[`Elden Ring Map Link`] \n  - If you hit him here, he will die no matter the damage and will drop his belongings, ending the quest. This prevents the player from obtaining the Patches' Crouch gesture.\r\n- `Dancer's Castanets` can be given to `Tanith`. \n    \t- Apparently, this has no effect.\r\n \r\n \r\n1. He will move back to Murkwater Cave as a boss, but will surrender almost immediately, giving the Patches' Crouch gesture. After accepting his surrender, attacking him three times will cause him to become aggressive again. If you allow him to reduce your HP to a low amount, he will offer to accept your surrender if you grovel. If you perform the Grovel for Mercy gesture, you will automatically learn the Extreme Repentance gesture.  Reload the area to access his shop. (He does not restock.)If his attacks interrupt your Grovel For Mercy gesture, he may still remain hostile despite granting you the Extreme Repentance gesture.  Simply quit the game or Alt+F4.  Upon reloading the area, he will no longer be hostile and he will re-open his shop to the player.\r\n### Patches Combat Information\r\n- Health: NG (??), NG+ (??), NG++ (??), NG+3 (??), NG+4 (??), NG+5 (??), NG+6 (??), NG+7 (??)\r\n- Defenses do not change between phases - a firebomb will do the same damage in phase 1 as in phase 2.\r\n- Deals ??

He can be found most commonly at his office, absorbed by an endless amount of books.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Gideon Ofnir Location in Elden Ring\r\nGideon Ofnir can be found at `Roundtable Hold`\r\n- This NPC changes locations, both within `Roundtable Hold` and The Lands Between, as the story progresses. \r\n \r\n### Gideon Ofnir Questline: How to complete Gideon Ofnir's Quest\r\n**Gideon Ofnir** is the leader of `Roundtable Hold`, and the foster parent of `Nepheli Loux`.\r\n- When you first meet **Gideon Ofnir**, he makes it clear that you are not a true member of the *Roundtable*, but a mere visitor. In order to be accepted as such, you'd have to obtain a `Great Rune` and receive the wisdom of the `Two Fingers`.\r\n- After finding your first Great Rune, Gideon will detail the location of other major shardbearers\r\n- After defeating Morgott, the Omen King, Gideon will provide the names of additional more-secluded shardbearers, and reward you for bringing him information on their location.  \n  \t- After reaching `Mohgwyn Dynasty Mausoleum`, telling Gideon rewards you with `Fevor's Cookbook [3]`\r\n\t- After reaching `Miquella's Haligtree`, he rewards you with `Black Flame's Protection`.\r\n\t- After killing `Mohg, Lord of Blood`, talking to him rewards you with `Law of Causality`.\r\n\t- After killing `Malenia, Blade of Miquella,`  he rewards you with `Lord's Divine Fortification`.\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Gideon Ofnir\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Oh, this is a rare occasion. **I can't remember the last time a new Tarnished made their way to the Roundtable.**Very well. As your senior, I bid you welcome. **It is safe here. You may let down your guard.*\r\n- *Allow me a word of advice, as your senior. **You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more.**A house guest, yet to earn their keep. **Remember your place, newcomer.*\r\n- *There's nothing left to say. Be at your leisure.*\r\nNext visit after introduction\r\n- *\"What do you need? I have little time to spare\".*\r\n- \t- *\"Oh, are you aggrieved? At the notion you are but a visitant here?**Then you would do well to remember the first words of grace given to you.**Stand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord.**If those words held any meaning to you...**Follow the guidance of grace, lay low the shardbearers, and claim for yourself a Great Rune.**Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open.**And you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers.*\r\n\t- *\"Once the wisdom of the Two Fingers becomes your own, I'll impart to you a proper welcome.**As a true member of the Roundtable. **I have high hopes for you\".**I'm sick and tired of them. **These namby-pamby Tarnished think us no more than a shelter from the rain...*\r\n\t- *\"We've spoken long enough. I have matters to attend to\".*\r\n \r\nAfter speaking to `Enia`\r\n- *You've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not? Then, just as promised, I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable. I am known as Gideon Ofnir. As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord, I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing. You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant.*\r\nVisit\r\n- *You'll be after more Great Runes, now eh? Then as your fellow, allow me to divulge a little knowledge. The inheritors of the Great Runes; the shardbearers. We of the Roundtable know the location of five of them, including the one you defeated. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil. General Radahn, who fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds.Praetor Rykard, Lord of the Volcano Manor of Mt. Gelmir. Morgott the Grace-Given, Veiled Monarch and Lord of Leyndell. And Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, ruler of Raya Lucaria's Academy.*\r\n- *... You'll still be after more Great Runes, won't you?*\r\nAbout `Godrick`\r\n- *So. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil. Despite being the blood of Godfrey, first Elden Lord, he's a grotesque old fool, grasping for power. His castle lies upon the cliff to Limgrave's northwest, but I suspect you know that well enough already.*\r\nAbout `Radahn`\r\n- *General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior. He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east. And now Caelid has been engulfed by the scarlet rot, even approaching the region is no mean feat. I've heard survivors of Radahn's army are still in the wilds, staving off the rot with fire. And if it's true, I suspect Radahn is still there as well, in Caelid. Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore...*\r\nAbout `Rykard`\r\n- *Praetor Rykard is the Lord of the Volcano Manor on Mt. Gelmir. He is a ruthless justiciar who commands a company of inquisitors, reviled for his serpentine demeanour. The volcano, Mt. Gelmir, lies in the west of the Altus Plateau; the realm of the Erdtree. It was the stage of the most appalling battle in the entirety of the Shattering. Rykard has commited the grave sin of blasphemy. Marking himself as an enemy, never to be forgiven.*\r\nAbout `Morgott`\r\n- *Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city. It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau. But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there. Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring. Set your sights elsewhere for the time being. The Veiled Monarch can wait.*\r\nAbout `Rennala` and `The Academy of Raya Lucaria`\r\n- *The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia. Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy. But Rennala herself is no demigod. Her beloved, Radagon, left her to become Queen Marika's second husband, taking the title of King Consort. The Great Rune dwells withing the amber egg that was Radagon's gift to her.*\r\nAbout `Nepheli`\r\n- *I understand you've been speaking to Nepheli. She is my daughter. I took her in when she lost the guidance of grace. Tough a mere axe-wielding barbarian, her youthful credulity suited my purposes. So I put her to work. Do not hesitate to employ her, should her services benefit you. Despite her looks, she is more than capable in the press of battle. *\r\n- *[After beating the Omenkiller in Albinauric Village] Ahh, you've already heard? Indeed, it seemed the whelp harboured suspicions. So I have no further use for her. Honestly, what's a man to do. A determined plebian is more wicked than an Omen horn, quite frankly. I suspect... that's just what the Queen wants. A dose of ambition, to incite the Tarnished.*\r\nShowing `Selvius's` Potion\r\n- *Is that potion what I think it is? Bloody Selvius. I suppose he's up to something again.**Oh, I won't interfere. You go ahead and do what you must. The Roundtable has no code to speak of.  **But, I ask you this. Are you really going to do the bidding of that twisted dolly botherer?**Or would you rather hand that potion to me, and see if we can't get one over on the bastard?*\r\n- *[Hand over Selvius's Potion] Good. I'll dispose of the potion myself. You go and see Selvius, but don't give anything away. **Just tell him that you tricked your mark into drinking the potion as planned.**Despite knowing next to bloody nothing, he's so far up his own arse he won't suspect a thing.**His inevitable display of arrogance will certainly be a sight to behold.*\r\n- *[Don't hand it over] Well, I won't force you. But I think your plan would be a dreadful waste. She's not herself right now, and though I have no need for her, she still has potential. Certainly more value than she'd have as a bloody puppet.*\r\nAfter defeating `Ensha`\r\n- *Oh, my apologies for that nasty business. Ensha got rather ahead of himself, it seems. As his master, I'd like to express my regret. But now, Ensha is slain and gone. Finished, forever more. *\r\n- *Ah, yes, by way of apology, allow me to tender some advice, in regard to the half of the secret medallion you possess. Find the Albinauric woman. She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia. She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure.*\r\nAfter defeating `Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon`\r\n- *Well. I see you've found another Great Rune. **Wonderful. You are a worthy fellow Tarnished, indeed.**Make the journey. **To the capital Leyndell, that lies to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree.**The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer. **You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring.**For we are Tarnished. And we must answer the call of grace.*\r\nAfter defeating `Morgott, the Omen King`\r\n- Where should I go? \n  \t- *\"If you're heading to the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants.**You'll need to find the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region.**Go, if you would. Take no heed of \"cardinal sin\".The Two Fingers lost their purpose a long, long time ago.\"*\r\n \r\nUnlocated demigods\r\n- *\"There are for more demigods yet to be located. Miquella of the Haligtree, the Unalloyed. His twin, Malenia, the undefeated swordswoman. Lunar Princess Ranni, daughter to Rennala. And the one only known as the Lord of Blood. Ranni is said to have cast aside her Great Rune, so here at the Hold, we seek the whereabouts of the remaining three shardbearers. If you should learn anything of these matters, I'll trade your findings for a hidden treasure, or a long-lost rite, known only to me. We both desire to stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord. As such, I hope we are compelled to work together.\"*\r\nAfter `Nepheli Loux` leaves for Stormveil Castle Throne Room\r\n- *I hear you helped get the girl back on her feet.**Though I'm not her foster father anymore, I'd still like to thank you.**Sorry. For the time you had to waste.*\r\nAfter reaching `Consecrated Snowfield`\r\n- *Ahh, I see you've laid your hands on the other secret medallion.I'm glad to see my counsel has borne fruit, but the honour of the deed is yours alone.You've made more of yourself than Ensha has...Now, more importantly, both secret medallions are in your hands.I suppose you'd like to know then? What awaits you on the path ahead?Me too, my friend, me too. I wait with baited breath.*\r\nAfter reaching `Miquella's Haligtree`\r\n- *Ahh, so the secret medallion led you to the land of the Haligtree?**I'd expect to find Malenia there. She who fought Radahn to a standstill.Well, if the scarlet rot hasn't eaten her away completely.But...with the Haligtree as it is... I suppose Miquella must already be...Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:A secret rite known only to me.You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.*[Gives `Black Flame's Protection`]\r\nAfter defeating `Malenia, Blade of Miquella`\r\n- *So. The Haligtree, now but a husk... I heard speculation Miquella embedded himself in the Haligtree,**but before he could finish, someone cut the tree open and absconded with his infant form.**Indeed, it seems those words held weight.

All I ask is that you remain constant.*[Gives `Lord's Divine Fortification`]\r\nAfter reaching `Mohgwyn Dynasty Mausoleum`\r\n- *Oh, so that's where the so-called Lord of Blood was hiding himself eh.**A fitting little squat for that deluded maniac to bleat about the revival of his precious dynasty, while he turns our fellow Tarnished into Bloody Fingers.**Let him stay there.

    "mainContent": "**Nepheli Loux, Warrior** is an `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. **Nepheli Loux** is a fellow warrior and tarnished who was ordered by decree from her adoptive `father` to kill and dethrone Godrick. She wears `clothing` similar to the starting `Hero` class, and she can help you in the battle against `Godrick the Grafted` if summoned. Her summoning sign is golden and is just outside the boss fog. Other `NPC Summon` opportunities include boss fights against `Godfrey, First Elden Lord` and `Omenkiller` (`Village of the Albinaurics`). Progress in her questline to have her summon sign available for these encounters. \r\n \r\nThe puppet of **Nepheli Loux** can be summoned for aid in battle by using the `Nepheli Loux Puppet Ashes`.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Nepheli Loux Location in Elden Ring\r\nNepheli Loux can initially be found at `Stormveil Castle` inside a room before reaching the Secluded Cell `Site of Grace`, the linear path guarded by two grafted birds, leading to `Godrick the Grafted`, and directly opposite two soldiers and a giant. `Map Link`.\r\n- While outside `Roundtable Hold`, she can be attacked and drops `Stormhawk Axe` when defeated. \r\n- Her adoptive father is `Gideon Ofnir`, leader of `The Roundtable Hold`, normally found in the library. Her real father is presumed to be `Godfrey, The First Elden Lord`.\r\n- After defeating `Godrick the Grafted` and exhausting the initial dialog with `Gideon Ofnir` at the `Roundtable Hold`, you can find her in front of his room.\r\n- After exhausting her dialogue at the `Roundtable Hold`, you can find her under the stone bridge leading up to the `Village Of The Albinaurics`. [`Map Link`]\r\n- After defeating the `Omenkiller`, she will then return to the `Roundtable Hold`, crouching near the bottom of the stairs next to the blacksmith.\r\n-  If the player speaks to Melina at the `Forge of Giants` grace (triggering the cutscene which causes the Roundtable Hold to burn) before finishing Nepheli's dialogue and defeating Omenkiller at Village of the Albinaurics, then she will disappear for good, her Stormhawk Axes drop at the village and the questline ends. To avoid this failure, defeat Omenkiller and finish her dialogue *before* resting at the Forge of Giants.\r\n \r\n### Nepheli Loux Questline: How to complete Nepheli Loux's Quest\r\nHer Father's Orders\r\n- Find Nepheli at the east side of the heavily guarded courtyard.\r\n- Exhaust her dialogues so that she offers her help in fighting `Godrick the Grafted`.\r\n- *(Optional)* Before you go through the gold fog door, there is a summoning sign next to it that you can use to summon Nepheli. \n  \t- Regardless if you are playing online or offline, you can still use her summoning sign.\r\n \r\n- After defeating `Godrick`, she moves to the library of the `Roundtable Hold`. Speak to her and exhaust her dialogues.  \n  \t- She won't move here if you didn't talk to `Gideon Ofnir` at all yet. Talk to him and reload at the `Site of Grace` and she will appear.\r\n\t- You must also rest at the Godrick the Grafted grace for her to appear at the Hold.\r\n \r\n- She'll then reward you with the `Arsenal Charm`.\r\n Seluvis's Potion\r\n- Finish her quest above, or skip it. Either way this quest will be doable. You must meet her at the `Roundtable Hold` once. \n  \t- : *If you offer her Seluvis's potion when meeting her in the Roundtable Hold the first time, she will refuse to take it. Once she returns to the Roundtable Hold from the Village of the Albinaurics, you can offer it again by speaking to Gideon about her despair.*\r\n \r\n- Speak to `Preceptor Seluvis` and receive the quest. \n  \t- If Seluvis is dead, you can continue on with the quest starting from the next step regardless.\r\n \r\n- Find her at the `Village Of The Albinaurics` exhaust her dialogue and defeat the elite enemy `Omenkiller` which can be found on the other side of the bridge above her.\r\n- Return to the `Roundtable Hold` and find Nepheli downstairs, next to the first fog wall. Speak to her.\r\n- Speak to `Gideon Ofnir` and ask him about Nepheli. \n  \t- If the player has the `potion`, he will offer you a choice: either give him the potion so that he can dispose of it or give it to Nepheli. If it is given to Nepheli, she will become unresponsive and leave. She can then be found in Seluvis' secret room, turned into a puppet. \n    \t\t- Either way, you can return to Preceptor Seluvis to complete his portion of the quest.\r\n \r\n\t- If the player does not have the `potion`, the quest progresses along the line where Nepheli does not take the potion. \n    \t\t- This happens if Seluvis is dead and the player found Nepheli at the Albinauric Village and killed the Omen Killer having never received the quest from Seluvis. This can still happen if Seluvis is still alive.\r\n \r\n \r\n- The `Stormhawk King` found in the `Chapel of Anticipation` can be given to Nepheli in `Roundtable Hold`, provided she did not take `Seluvis's Potion`.\r\n- `Roderika`'s quest line must be progressed to the point where she can upgrade spirit ashes before you can give Nepheli the `Stormhawk King`. If you reach `Crumbling Farum Azula`, `Roderika` and `Hewg` will have some new dialogue which must be completed before you can continue (despite being essentially unrelated)\r\nLord of Limgrave\r\n- After completing the quest above by not giving Nepheli `Seluvis's Potion` you must complete `Kenneth Haight's` quest to the point where he's in Fort Haight saying he has to look for a fitting lord to rule Limgrave.\r\n- You can find Nepheli, Kenneth and Gostoc in the Stormveil Castle throne room near the `Godrick the Grafted` site of grace. If they are not appearing, spawn from `Godrick the Grafted` and **rest at the `Secluded Cell` site of grace** (do not teleport to it), which may fix the issue. (If this doesn't work, you can try going back to `Fort Haight`, where `Kenneth Haight` usually stands, which might trigger him and `Nepheli` to move to the throne room). \n  \t- **Prerequisites:** `Morgott` must be defeated before all 3 NPCs can appear in the throne room. The quest will still advance if either Kenneth or Gostoc is dead. You must talk to `Gideon` about helping Nepheli get back on her feet to allow her to move to the throne room. **WARNING:** Killing Gideon prevents this dialogue and results in Nepheli dying where she is at the time, leaving her items behind.\r\n\t- **Rewards:** Nepheli will gift the player an `Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone` at the end of her questline. She can also be summoned for the fight with `Godfrey, First Elden Lord` in `Leyndell, Ashen Capital`.\r\n\t- An additional `Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone` will be sold by `Gatekeeper Gostoc` for 20,000 runes. (Not applicable to his bell bearings if he was killed)\r\n \r\n**Ranni the Witch**\r\nYou must progress `Ranni the Witch's Questline` until you have defeated the `Baleful Shadow` before `Nepheli Loux` and `Kenneth Haight` will appear in Godrick the Grafted's Throne Room.\r\n- Side-note\r\n(I may be incorrect in steps of progression within **Ranni's** questline, however after completing all other pre-requisites, and progressing **Ranni the Witch**'s questline (which upon completion of each step, and checking upon Stormveil)) is when I finally noticed, after so much frustration with **Nepheli Loux** and **Kenneth Haight** not moving from `Forth Haight` or the `Roundtable Hold's` basement, and consistently checking upon **Stormveil's Throne**, `Gostoc's` disappearance from **Godrick The Grafted's Courtyard**. And, after which upon teleporting to `Godrick the Grafted's Site of Grace` had finally achieved `Kenneth Haight` and `Nepheli Loux's` appearance within Godrick the Grafted's Throne Room within Stormveil Castle.)- Side-Note 2:(You may only need to slay **Starscourge Radahn** for **Nepheli Loux** and Kenneth Haight to move to **Godrick the Grafted's** Throne Room. I did not need to defeat Baleful Shadow, only Radahn and grab the Finger Blade to have them move.)\r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Nepheli Loux\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *\"Be proud. You were a fine warrior.**Your only mistake was your choice of master.**Let the winds lift you, to a higher place.\"*\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- *I see. You are but a simple villain. Let the scars remind you; this lesson comes from Nepheli Loux!*\r\n- (On player kill)* You wouldn't even register as a threat to father. Hurry up and die.*\r\nWhen killed\r\n- *Father... I am slain. Please...become Elden Lord...*\r\nSpeaking to Nepheli\r\n- *\"Well, who do we have here?**Tarnished, are you? Clearly not one of Godrick's lot.**I am Nepehli Loux.. Tarnished and warrior, like you.**I'm here by decree of my father.**How utterly repellant this is...**This \"grafting\" of Godrick's ill befits a Lord.**He's tainted the very winds.\"*\r\n- *\"If you intend to challenge Godrick,**I ask you call upon me.**The winds run could with his deeds.**I'm certain father would permit me aid the fight.\"*\r\nSmall Talk\r\n- *\"Apologies, but I've idled long enough.**As fellow Tarnished we must each follow our own guidance.* *Down whatever road takes us to the throne of Elden Lord.*\r\nAt the Roundtable\r\n- *\"You again...I thought you'd receive a summons to the Roundtable.Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.I'm glad to see you here. I have something for you.I found it in Godrick's grafting grounds.You defeated him. You should have it. Make good use of it. I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses.\"*\r\n- *\"Ah yes. **I wonder if you've met my foster father?He's in his study. The room `Ensha's` guarding just over there.If you haven't already, I advise you introduce yourself.Father is the leader of the Roundtable.I'm sure talking to him will be worth your while.\"*\r\n- *\"It's about time I headed off.I'll see you again, warrior, should the fates deign it.\"*\r\nAt the Village of the Albinaurics\r\n- *Oh, it's you... Well, what do you make of it? What's happened to this village?I witnessed a sight much the same, in my infancy.The oppression of the weak. Murder and pillage unchecked.A waking nightmare, made by men.*\r\n- *But this time, I'm a woman grown.And though the suffering cannot be undone, I can still mete out justice.Justice to the oppressors.Let the scars I carve remind them. I am Nepheli Loux, Warrior.*\r\nAt the Roundtable Hold after defeating the boss of the Village of the Albinaurics\r\n- *Ah, you... Please, leave me be. It's pathetic, I know, but I...need to think.*\r\n- (After speaking to Gideon)***...So you know already, do you? Right. It's true. My father cast me out.For indulging my emotions. Forgetting the mission. Punishment for offing his pawns.Father...rather, Lord Gideon has offered me guidance all my life.I would have done anything for him, to place him on the throne of Elden Lord.And yet I... Though it was not my intent... I betrayed him...*\r\n- *I...can no longer trust in father... To think he'd order his men to enact such tragedy... Where is the justice he purports, in that? He once told me that if he became Elden Lord, he would never allow the downtrodden to be cheated ever again.Was he simply lying to me?*\r\n- *No, no, no... How could I say that? Father has always given me his guidance... And now...I've lost it...*\r\nAfter giving her the Stormhawk King\r\n- *\"In this ash, I can smell the ancient storm.**It reminds me of my first hawk.\"*\r\n- *I'm... not like Roderika. I don't feel the presence of spirits, let alone see them.Still, this ash... It reminds me of my first hawk. Thank you*\r\n At Stormveil Castle throne room\r\n- *\"It's been some time. I must thank you, for your aid.**I told father I would be with him no longer.**I remembered the vow I took when I first became a warrior, so many moons ago.**This land is much like the one from which I hail.**I will call upon the storm, to drive away the foulness that has settled on the winds.\"*\r\n- *\"Again, I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.**Some call me by the title of Lady, but I remain the same woman underneath.**Though I have now abandoned my former guidance.**I cannot express how much you've helped me.**Should you become Elden Lord. I would gladly lighten your burden.\"*\r\n- *\"Farewell, fellow warrior. I will remain, to summon the storm.**But your guidance, and your fight... Surely lie elsewhere.\"*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Nepheli Loux Notes & Trivia\r\n- Patch 1.03 *(March 17, 2022)* added new progression to her questline, tied with `Kenneth Haight` and `Gatekeeper Gostoc`. Traveling to the Godrick the Grafted site of grace, then resting at it seems to trigger all 3 NPCs moving into the throne room.\t- Kenneth's questline must be advanced to the point where he is at `Fort Haight`. Nepheli must not have been given `Seluvis's Potion` and been given the `The Stormhawk King`. Defeating `Morgott` is required before the NPCs will move to the throne room.\r\n\t- If either Kenneth or Gostoc is dead, the questline can still advance. However, Gostoc will sell 1x `Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone` which cannot be obtained if he is dead. Nepheli will also give you one, meaning that a total of 2 can be obtained from completing this questline.\r\n\t- Patch 1.03.2 *(March 23, 2022)* fixed Nepheli disappearing if the player has defeated `Maliketh`. Previously, she would disappear from the Roundtable Hold, leaving behind 2x `Stormhawk Axes` but would not appear in Godrick's throne room. She will now appear in the throne room as long as all quest conditions are met.\r\n\t- Nepheli is a name which means \"She who comes from the clouds\" in Greek. It is also a reference to the Nepheleia who are the nymphs of clouds and rain in Greek mythology.\r\n \r\n- Can be summoned in the fight against Godfrey, First Elden Lord\r\n- In combat, Nepheli wields a pair of `Stormhawk Axes`\r\n"

Found near at the Lake-Facing Cliffs site of grace, `Liurna of the Lakes`, [`Map Link`] (Requires receiving `Irina's Letter` from `Irina` in the `Weeping Peninsula`.)\r\n1.

Found at `Frenzied Flame Proscription`, far below Leyndell, Royal Capital. [`Elden Ring Map Link`]\r\n \r\n- This NPC moves as you progress her questline.\r\n- This NPC can be fought\r\n- If defeated, drops: 3 `Frenzyflame Stone` (at location #3)\r\n  \r\n### Hyetta Questline: How to complete Hyetta's Quest\r\n- **Hyetta** is initially found next to the Lake-Facing Cliffs Site of Grace. **Hyetta** says she roams The Lands Between in search of the distant light, drawn to her destiny by a guiding shine she feels in the back of her eyes when eating `Shabriri Grapes`. She will ask for one and if you choose to supply one to her, she will reward you with the `As You Wish Gesture`.\r\n- **Hyetta** can next be found on the western side of the `Purified Ruins` in Liurnia. She asks for another `Shabriri Grape` but does not offer a reward at this time.\r\n- **Hyetta** will now be north of the `Gate Town Bridge`, `Liurnia of the Lakes`. She will ask for another `Shabriri Grape`, and will ask what they really are. Choose to tell her what they are, the quest cannot progress until you tell her. Upon reloading the area, she will have more dialogue. Exhausting her dialogue here is mandatory, as she will not change locations otherwise.\r\n- **Hyetta** will now be at the `Bellum Church`, `Liurnia of the Lakes`. She will ask you for a `Fingerprint Grape`, which is found as a drop from `Festering Fingerprint Vyke` near the `Church of Inhibition`. Once given to her, she will thank you and leave.\r\n- **Hyetta** can be finally found at `Frenzied Flame Proscription`, underneath `Leyndell, Royal Capital`. Upon accepting the Three Fingers flame, return to Hyetta and talk to her once more. Exhaust her dialogue, and she will give you the `Frenzied Flame Seal`, completing her questline. \n  \t- **Note**: \r\n \r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Hyetta\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *\"Hello? Is someone there? My name is Hyetta, and I'm journeying in search of the distant light. If I might be so bold as to ask... would you donate any Shabriri grapes in your possession to me? My eyesight has been weak since birth, you see. I can't tell which way I'm supposed to go next. But when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel a distant light in the back of my eyes. It will lead me, to my true duty, as a Finger Maiden\".*\r\n- (If given a Shabriri grape)*\"Oh, many thanks to you. Now I can feel the distant light once more. You are most kind, indeed. May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you\".*\r\nAfter Given a `Shabriri Grape` at the `Purified Ruins`\r\n- *You're not like the others who give me grapes, are you...They rest their trembling hands upon me. Howling wordlessly, they gently stroke my eyes. Their frail fingers, emaciated...Yet still, they give me the grapes. But you...seem somehow...firmer. You are most kind, indeed. May the blessings of the Fingers be upon you. *\r\nAfter Given a `Shabriri Grape` at the `Gate Town Bridge`\r\n- *I wonder, what are Shabiri Grapes? Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing... What sight they must behold. \"*\r\nAfter telling her the grapes are actually human eyes\r\n- *N-no... that's not possible. Not all of those people...their own...so those noises I heard were...- [brief pause, gags] **Sorry, I'm alright now. I apologize. You only did what I asked. I'll be fine. Think no more of it. **[As you walk away you can hear her start to hurl]*\r\nAfter reloading the same area and talking to her again\r\n- *Ah, is that you over there? I have gleaned something very important indeed, thanks to you. The reason why it was eyes I had to eat. The distant light is far and frail. So faint it can't be seen by the naked eye. But with everyone's eyes together, it appears. Finally, it all makes sense. I am certain now, I will become a finger maiden.*\r\nAsking for a `Fingerprint Grape` at `Bellum Church`\r\n- *Oh hello, is that you over there? Have you ever heard of fingerprint grapes? They're special grapes which only grow on those who've been clasped by the burnt Fingers. I would truly love to try one.... The distant light seems far closer than before. But I can't sense a thing from the usual grapes anymore... Please, could you donate a fingerprint grape to me? Without one I don't know, I feel like I might go mad.*\r\nAfter giving a `Fingerprint Grape` at `Bellum Church`\r\n- *Oh, Oh! A fingerprint grape, tried and true, what a wondrous thing! A fingerprint grape! <eating noises> Ohh, how sweet, yet, how it burns... <wordless joy> Thank you. I've composed myself again. May the blessings of the Fingers be upon you.*\r\n- *Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. I'm sure I'll be a Finger Maiden.*\r\nAt `Frenzied Flame Proscription`\r\n- *Ah, so you're here as well, are you? ...I realized as we've talked. I'll be a Maiden. And you... surely, a Lord. Go to the door ahead, after divesting yourself of your possessions. It will surely open, and the Three Fingers will welcome you. May the flame of chaos find purchase within you.*\r\nAfter the Tarnished is marked by the `Three Fingers`\r\n- *Ahhh, the flame of chaos has nestled within you. Could you please rest your hand upon me? Burn me with the flame, to make me your Maiden...*\r\nAfter touching Hyetta\r\n- *Oh, it burns... My eyes, my eyes, they're melting... Aaargh!*\r\n- *Thank... thank you... I have touched them. The words of the Three Fingers. As your maiden, allow me to divine them. All that there is came from the One Great. Then came fractures, and births, and souls. But the Greater Will made a mistake. Torment, despair, affliction... every sin, every curse. Every one, born of the mistake. And so, what was borrowed must be returned. Melt it all away, with the yellow chaos flame. Until all is One again.*\r\n- *Those who gave me grapes howled without words. Saying they wished they were never born. Become their lord. Take their torment, despair. Their affliction. Every sin, every curse. And melt it all away. As the Lord of Chaos. No more fractures...no more birth... (sighs)*\r\nSmall Talk\r\n- At the Lake-Facing Cliffs site of grace : \"*You are most kind, indeed. May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.*\"\r\nAfter attacking\r\n- *What on earth? I do not wish to cause anyone harm...*\r\n- (On player kill)* Oh, bless the stars. You've chosen to reconsider.*\r\nUpon defeat\r\n- *Ahh, the distant light...fades... I'm so sorry, my dears...*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Hyetta Notes & Trivia\r\n- Hyetta can be the maiden mentioned in the `White-Faced Varré`'s questline. While killing a maiden is not necessary, you can kill her to cover the Lord of Blood's Favor in blood.\r\n- If you wish to complete her quest, make sure to finish `Irina` & `Edgar`'s Questlines (make your way to `Revenger's Shack` before talking to her at location #3 [possibly even location #2]) As progressing too far into Hyetta's quest without fully completing hers and his, can cause `Edgar the Revenger` to never spawn, locking out the third required `Shabriri Grape`\r\n- When hostile, her title is Lightseeker Hyetta. \r\n- Irina and Hyetta have the same face and clothing. \n  \t- It may be possible that after Irina's death, her body was taken over by Hyetta, just like `Yura's` body was taken over by `Shabriri,` after his demise. However, even after meeting Hyetta, Irina's body remains where it is.\r\n \r\n- Her quest can still be completed after using `Miquella's Needle` and/or getting an ending.\r\n \r\n"

In the room with `Knight Bernahl` (second/third left door in hallway) will be a `Letter from Volcano Manor` on the table for you. Read the note and then assassinate `Rileigh the Idle` in `Atlus Plateau`.\r\n- Return to Tanith and you'll be rewarded with the `Serpentbone Blade`.\r\n- Reload. In the room with `Knight Bernahl` will be a `Red Letter` on the table for you. It tells you to assassinate `Juno Hoslow, Knight of Blood`. His invasion mark is located in `Mountaintops of the Giants`. [`Elden Ring Map here`]\r\n- Return to Tanith and you'll be rewarded with `Taker's Cameo`. \n  \t- Note: If you have defeated `Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy` before returning, the reward will appear on the table on the same spot as the letters.\r\n \r\n- Once you have completed her assassination quests, she will ask if you would like to meet their lord. Accepting her request takes you directly to a site of grace immediately before the boss `Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy`.\r\n- Once you have defeated `Rykard`, return to Tanith and speak to her once more.\r\n- Once Tanith has disappeared from Volcano Manor, you will find her back in Rykard's boss area feasting on his corpse. From here she can be killed for her gearset, `Consort's Set`. Doing so causes her bodyguard to invade you. Upon their defeat they will drop `Aspect of the Crucible: Breath`. \n  \t- Note: It is unconfirmed whether this is her final destination. Reports have shown she will still be eating Rykard's corpse at the end of the game. Receiving the `Dancer's Castanets` from `Patches` will not continue her quest after Rykard is defeated.\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Tanith\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Aren't you precocious. We rarely receive visitors to the Volcano Manor without invitation. Fascinating. And not unlike another guest we had long ago...So, Tarnished, have you ever harboured doubts? About the burden of grace, and the dogmatic ramblings of the Fingers? If you have,  why not join the Volcano Manor, and fight with us? Rise with us, against the Erdtree.*\r\nIntroduction after journeying with `Rya`\r\n- *Brave Tarnished, welcome to the Volcano Manor. I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house. Rya spoke well of you. \"A warrior of promise\", I believe she said. Perhaps you are prepared to make a commitment. Will you join us here at the Volcano Manor, and resist the tide? Why accept the burden of their grace, or be fooled by the dogmatic ramblings of the Fingers? Rise with us, against the Erdtree. *\r\nJoin Volcano Manor\r\n- *Your decision is most welcome. Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family. The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable. I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house. An honour to have you. (Gives the `Drawing-Room Key`)*\r\nAfter you read the letter\r\n- *Did you read the letter left for you? That is the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact.You will be compensated once the deed is done. Good luck. If you are loath to hunt your own kin, so be it. But you must leave this house at once. This is a war against the Erdtree. We have no place for the meek, nor the luxury of keeping clean hands. *\r\nAfter completing the first quest\r\n- *You've completed your task. I am pleased. Now you are a recusant true, and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor. This is your reward as promised. (Gives `Magma Shot`). Never forget. That the recusant fights to tread the path of the champion. The way is tainted, but for this very reason, it is the true path to valour.*\r\nAfter completing the second quest\r\n- *I see you've performed another task for us. Here is your usual reward. Please, take it. (Gives `Serpentbone Blade`). Now, perhaps the time has come to tell you. Of the true ruler of this manor, Lord Rykard. The Erdtree blessed the Tarnished with grace. But it was all too meagre, in the fate of the enormity of their task. The Tarnished were forced to scavenge, squabbling for crumbs. Like the shardbearers, vying for power in the wake of the Shattering. Our Lord, indignant, had refused. To scurry about, fighting over what miserly scraps they allow us. If the Erdtree, and indeed the very gods, would debase us so, then we are willing to raise the banner of resistance, even if it means heresy. We at the Volcano Manor, under Lord Rykard, have sworn no rest until it is done. If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you. The Lord's visits with our champions are always a spectacle. I cannot come a day too soon!*\r\nAfter completing the third quest\r\n- *I see that you've stayed the path of champions. This is your usual reward. Please, take it. (Gives `Taker's Cameo`). Perhaps you are ready. Might you see our Lord? Our Lord will no doubt welcome you. Another kindred spirit, treading the path of champions.*\r\n- (See the Lord)* Now, close your eyes for a moment. I will transport you to the Lord's chamber.*\r\n- *Farewell, then. May your visit be fruitful.*\r\nAfter defeating Rykard\r\n- *You... It's true then. You've defeated out Lord. No, I must thank you. Our Lord was yet weak. You have taught us that. Defeat is not the end. Our Lord is immortal, and will one day rise again, stronger. Until then, I must stay the path, and do my part. *\r\n- *I will leave the Volcano Manor before long. I suggest you do the same. I will miss these encounters. The champion who walks the tainted path shines all the more. I always was an admirer.*\r\n- *This is farewell. Perhaps we will meet again, along the path.*\r\nZorayas's Form\r\n- *Did you see her? The girl, Rya... with her true face... Well, if she confided in you the name Zorayas, then perhaps it is not my place to speak. But as her adoptive mother, I ask of you. Please, be kind to her. Look after young Zorayas. Her true visage belies the purity of her heart... Honestly, I hardly deserve the sweet child.*\r\nZorayas's troubles\r\n- *I should have known something was wrong. The signs were clear enough. Well, Zorayas has placed her trust in you. All the more reason I must tell you. That some things are better left unknown. Besides, no-one should be blamed for their heritage. Think about it. We are resisting the ways of the Erdtree itself. What matters one's lineage in such a crisis.*\r\nZorayas's absence\r\n- *And she has no scouting duties now. Has she gone off in search of answers? Why won't she just listen...*\r\n- *May I ask your aid? Not as the Manor's proprietress, but as Zorayas' mother. If she discovers the answer to her question, and it causes distress, have her drink this potion. To purge that which would cause her pain. (Gives `Tonic of Forgetfulness`). Yes, I know. My wish is a grave disrespect to her. No different than the Erdtree's impostion. But I've no choice... It must be done.*\r\nAfter giving Rya the tonic\r\n- *I will never be a good mother. My heart is too frail. Our Lord must have known this all along. My meekness is all too clear...*\r\n- *Sweet Zorayas, have I earned your scorn?*\r\nAfter killing Rya\r\n- *My gratitude for your forthrightness. If you would...allow me some time alone.*\r\nWhen you find her eating off Rykard's corpse\r\n- *Oh, you... Allow me some time. Our lord's carcass is vast and not easily consumed. Dear Rykard, please find purchase within me, I wish to be your serpent; your family. One day, let us devour the gods together.*\r\n- *(Gives the `Dancer's Castanets`) What is it? I have no need of that. I must continue devouring my beloved lord.*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Tanith Notes & Trivia\r\n- Before Tanith came to Volcano Manor, she was working as a dancer. Rykard came upon her and made her his consort, making her the only human to remain on his side when he became the serpent of blasphemy. Tanith has shown to have a strong obsession for Rykard.\r\n- The `Consort's Mask` dropped by Tanith raises your dexterity by 1.\r\n \r\n###  Tanith Image Gallery\r\n\r\n \r\n"

    "mainContent": "**Rya** is an `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. **Rya** acts as a scout for the `Volcano Manor`, and is the adopted daughter of Tanith.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Rya Location in Elden Ring\r\nRya can be found at `Volcano Manor`. [`Elden Ring Map here`]\r\nEnd of Questline Location [`Elden Ring Map here`]\r\n- This NPC moves\r\n- This NPC can be fought \n  \t- She cannot be harmed until she moves into the Volcano Manor dungeon\r\n \r\n- If defeated, drops: `Daedicar's Woe`\r\n  \r\n### Rya Questline: Points of Failure\r\n1. If you go to the `Volcano Manor` without speaking to Rya at `Liurnia of the Lakes`, you will lose access to `Blackguard Big Boggart` and his questline for the rest of that playthrough, as he will refuse to speak with you if you haven't spoken with Rya in the swamp about retrieving a necklace from someone who stole it. This will also render you unable to purchase `Boiled Prawn` and `Boiled Crab`. (However, you can enter the Manor and touch the grace in the room where `Tanith` and her knight protector reside without losing access to Blackguard Big Boggart's questline as long as you do not speak to Tanith or anyone else in the Manor.)\r\n2. If you kill `Rykard` before speaking to Rya in her room inside the dungeon, she will disappear from the manor and her quest will become impossible to complete.\r\n3. If you complete all three of the manor's assassination contracts before gaining the `Tonic of Forgetfulness`, it will be impossible to acquire the Tonic. This closes some possible endings of the questline, but it can still be completed.\r\n \r\n### Rya Questline: How to complete Rya's Quest\r\n1. First meet her at `Liurnia of the Lakes` under the pavilion next to the Birdseye Telescope north of Laskyar ruins. Exhausting her dialogue she will ask you to retrieve a necklace from someone who stole it. `Map Link`\r\n1. Head north west from the pavilion until you reach the `Boilprawn Shack` and its Site of Grace.\r\n1. Speak to the thief there, `Blackguard Big Boggart`, who will offer to sell `Rya's Necklace` back to you for 1000 runes. Alternatively, you can kill him and it will drop. \n  - *: Killing Boggart here will lock you out of being able to complete his quest later*\r\n \r\n1. Return the necklace to her and she will reward you with a `Volcano Manor Invitation`.She will also tell you about the two main ways to reach `Altus Plateau`.\r\n1. When reaching `Altus Plateau`, you can talk to **Rya**, and she will teleport you inside `Volcano Manor`. Depending on which route you took to first reach the plateau, she can be found at one of two locations: \n  - the lower part of `Lux Ruins`, right next to Erdtree-Gazing Hill site of grace, if you went through the `Ruin-Strewn Precipice` first\r\n- the top of `Grand Lift of Dectus`, to the left of the top of the stairs leaving the lift platform, if you used the lift first\r\n- : If she does not appear at either of these locations, try teleporting to the Grand Lift and riding it to the top again to trigger her spawn.\r\n \r\n1. After joining Volcano Manor and completing the first part of Tanith questline (i.e., assassination of `Old Knight Istvan`) she will move to a different room in the manor and appear in her snake form. Speaking to her during her snake form will progress the questline. \n  -  If you do all contracts in the `Volcano Manor`, to the point where you get ported to `Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy` from `Tanith`, she will no longer have dialogue related to Rya and you will be unable to pursue her optional objectives in this questline.\r\n \r\n1. Complete the second part of Tanith questline: assassination of Rileigh the Idle\r\n1. She will be in human form in the same room where she was seen in her snake form.  she complains about hearing noises in the adjacent room: a clue to the secret passage therein. She asks you to investigate. To proceed in the questline, enter the illusory wall in the room right of hers and reach the grace in `Prison Town Church`. Return to Zorayas and tell her what you have seen to continue. \n  - : You must open the doors leaving Prison Town Church to continue in the questline.\r\n \r\n1. (OPTIONAL) Speak to `Lady Tanith` and choose the \"Zorayas' troubles\" option.\r\n1. Defeat `Godskin Noble` in `Temple of Eiglay` to get the `Serpent's Amnion`.\r\n1. Give the Serpent's Amnion to Zorayas and she will disappear from the manor.\r\n1. (OPTIONAL - But crucial, see step #13 below) Speaking to Lady Tanith will have the new option \"Zorayas' absence\". She will give a `Tonic of Forgetfulness` to give to the upset Zorayas.\r\n1. Zorayas has moved to the Legacy Dungeon's interior, in a small room adjacent to a lava pit filled with cages and skulls, just before a rope ladder. If you have fully unlocked the area, you can reach it by taking the wooden elevator next to the Temple of Eiglay, getting off at a hidden doorway just below the lift's highest point, and heading straight through the room, out a window, and jump across a lava floe. She is inside the room directly across.\t1. , you can reach the lava floe (or unlock the elevator) by jumping off the balcony of the top floor of Temple of Eiglay. \n    - To clarify - take the lift within the Temple of Eiglay (SE of the grace) up and go out through the door to reach the balcony. Jump down to the lava pit with slugs that leads to a rocky bridge you need to jump off, and then climb up the path afterwards. Hop across the lava to find a window on the left, but be ready for the **Iron Virgin **waiting behind the corner. Once inside there's a door to the right which leads to a bridge with a man-serpent - go passed him, the stairs, and then down the hall a bit to find a ladder in one of the windows to your left. You will find Rya in a small alcove at the bottom of it.\r\n \r\n\t1. You can also reach this room by taking the wooden elevator to the top, going straight ahead toward the man-serpent with the lava sword, and jumping out the windows on the left. \n    - To clarify - Turn NW from the Temple of Eiglay grace to find the door which leads to the lift if you have access. Right before it reaches the top there is a door leading to an open room with an enemy inside where you will find a window to jump out of. Straight across is Rya's alcove.\r\n \r\n \r\n1. In her new location, the player is given a choice between three actions:. \n  \t1. If you kill her, she will transform back into a snake and drop `Daedicar's Woe`.\r\n\t1. If you leave her alive and return after killing Rykard, she will have new dialogue. When you reset the area, she is gone and has left `Daedicar's Woe` and `Zorayas' Letter` in her place.\r\n\t1. If you give her the Tonic of Forgetfulness, she simply goes to sleep. After Rykard is killed and the Manor's inhabitants have all left, she will return to her original location in the Manor. Exhaust her dialogue and reload the area to find `Daedicar's Woe` in her place.\r\n \r\n1. If you get to Volcano Manor and complete her snake form questline before talking to `Blackguard Big Boggart`, the necklace won't trigger anything, so there is no reason to kill him for it(It is requested for his questline to buy it).**\r\n1. If you kill `Rykard` before speaking to Rya in her room inside the dungeon, it appears that she will disappear from the manor.\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Rya\r\nAt Liurnia of the Lakes\r\n- *Hello.**It's rather chilly here, isn't it? **My mistress sent me off on an errand...**But I was accosted by a ruffian, and now I'm in a bind. **Could I ask you to lend a hand, perhaps?**That thug made off with a precious necklace. I need someone to retrieve it.**Only... He, too, is Tarnished. **If you've any qualms confronting your own, I shall find another...*\r\nHear the Request\r\n- *Ohh, thank you dearly. What a blessing that we've met like this.The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way...Please, I must have the necklace back.*\r\nUpon attacking / rolling / jumping\r\n- *Please, stop, Brave Tarnished.**You will only tire by striking this barrier.**Besides I'm no foe of yours. Please think this over.*\r\n- *I see you've reconsidered. **Thank goodness.*\r\nGive Rya's Necklace\r\n- *Oh, yes, that is my missing necklace. **Thank you kindly. I am in your debt.**Did I forget to announce myself?**I am Rya, in the service of Lady Tanith of the Volcano Manor.**I seek stalwart Tarnished who might join our house. **You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand,**but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind. **Such strength is precisely what my mistress seeks.**Please, take this.* (Volcano Manor Invitation)\r\n- *Brave Tarnished, seek the Altus Plateau, the realm of the Erdtree.**Most Tarnished are Doomed to wander the outskirts of the Lands Between, peering wistfully at the towering Erdtree...**But you are no ordinary Tarnished. And once that is proven,**the Volcano Manor will fully extend its invitation. To fight, amongst a family of champions.*\r\n- *Ohh, and... One more thing, only for you...**This land of Liurnia is connected to the Altus Plateau by the Grand Lift of Dectus, beyond the High Road.**But the lift has been defunct for an age, meaning there's no simple means of* passage.Instead,* you must seek the old ruins in the cliff.**At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel.**It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau.**I have faith in you, A champion, through and throught.**I do hope that we can meet again.*\r\nAt the Grand Lift of Dectus/Lux Ruins\r\n- I've been waiting for you. I knew you had the stuff of champions. I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor. Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress.\r\n- (Accept) Give me your hand.I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith.\r\nAt Volcano Manor\r\n- (If she teleported you to Volcano Manor)* Hello again. Brave Tarnished.As a scout, I am pleased to see you again here at the Volcano Manor.Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.*\r\n- (If she didn't teleport you)* Hello again. Brave Tarnished.It is a shame that I did not beckon you here with my own hand, but I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor.Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.*\r\n- (If you haven't met her before) *A pleasure to meet you. Brave Tarnished. I am Rya, the scout. Very pleased to welcome you to the Volcano Manor. Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.*\r\nAfter completing the first Volcano Manor quest\r\n- *Have you ever...heard any strange sounds here at the manor?Something beyond the walls, like breathing, or slithering scales...Oh fie what am I saying? It just isn't possible. I must be tired.*\r\n- *Sometimes I hear strange sounds beyond the walls. Like breathing, or slithering scales.Oh, perhaps I'm just feeling tired.*\r\nAfter completing the second Volcano Manor quest\r\n- *Brave Tarnished, what is your business here? I'm afraid this is not a guest room.What's that peculiar look upon your face?Goodness, am I still a serpent? Oh, how dreadful... How dreadful indeed...Forgive my distress. I ought to be thanking you for treating me as usual, despite this appearance.Brave Tarnished. This is my true form. My real name is Zorayas.Please forgive the deception. Do understand. The duplicity is my own doing.Lady Tanith speaks no falsehoods, and the Volcano Manor is just as it seems.*\r\n- *Lady Tanith is my mother. I am told I was born by the grace of a glorious king.That my mother cherishes this form I inhabit. I am proud of what I am.But people are cruel. If they saw my true form, the wouldn't speak to me.And so I assume a guise when seeking new recruits.But you are not like the rest. *\r\n- *My serpentine form, and the name Zorayas, were secrets known only to Lady Tanith and I.Now I share the secrets with you, as well. Please keep them safe from anyone else.*\r\nAfter speaking to Tanith and reloading the area\r\n- *Um, oh, it's you. Forgive me. My mind never ceases to churn of late. Hmm, well... I know I can trust you...I saw something, slithering in the pitch black of night. It entered the room next to this one, and never came out.If I'm not mistaken, it took the form of a serpent, just like me... Does the Volcano Manor hide some secret, that Lady Tanith has kept from me?I realise that I shouldn't impose but, if you discover anything, would you please share?*\r\nTell her of the dark side of Volcano Manor\r\n- *Really... Oh, so there was a secret after all... Oh my...Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me...**Was I not... born by the grace of a king?*\r\nGiving her the Serpent's Amnion\r\n- *I remember this scent, distinctly. Funny, isn't it. I am certain of it. I was born inside this. It's a part of my birth mother.You have my gratitude. Thanks to you, I am no longer afraid.I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith.One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart.*\r\nAt Volcano Manor's dungeon\r\n- *Oh, it's you... I'm afraid... there is something I must tell you.**I was an unwanted child. Born not of grace, but of a hideous ritual.**Something that can never be accepted, not by men, nor serpents. Even Lady Tanith shouldn't accept me.**I know that you have done so much for me. But I wish to ask one last kindness. Kill me, please.**I thought that I feared nothing. But this... Free me from this accursed frame.*\r\nAccept her request\r\n- *Agh... Thank you... My champion... Mother...*\r\nGive Tonic of Forgetfulness\r\n- *Yes, of course. You always were very kind.*\r\n- *Ahh... How delightfully sweet... And yet...*\r\nAfter Rykard is defeated & tonic was given\r\n- *Oh, it's you. Heaven knows what happened here, but Lady Tanith, and all the Tarnished champions, are gone.**It feels rather quiet without them. But with you here, things will be just fine.*\r\n- *I await Lady Tanith. I am her daughter, born by the grace of a great king. I do not wish to burden her, or cause concern.**Brave Tarnished. Do tread the path of valour. I'm certain that this is what Lady Tanith wishes.*\r\nAfter Rykard is defeated and you leave her be\r\n- *You're not willing to kill me, are you. Hah... You've always been so kind. And uncompromising.*\r\n- *I suppose I knew in my heart of hearts. How kind, and uncompromising, you always were.*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Rya Notes & Trivia\r\n- A golden barrier is protecting her at her first location if rolling, jumping or attacking (near) her.\r\n- On the map (post-1.03), her name is displayed as Zorayas the Scout, if the she told the player her true name.\r\n \r\n \r\n"

From the Underground Roadside Site of Grace, head out the door, turn left, slip past the `Omen`s and fall into the gap in the sewer grate. Head straight to the end of the tunnel, fight past three `Giant Miranda Sprout`s, climb up the ladder and open the locked door on the opposite wall. You will need the `Sewer-Gaol Key` to open this door. [`Elden Ring Map here`]\r\nIf killed in the `Subterranean Shunning-Grounds`, he will drop the following:\r\n- `Omen Helm `\r\n- `Omen Armor`\r\n- `Omen Gauntlets `\r\n- `Omen Greaves `\r\n- `Sword of Milos`\r\n He can also be found around the lake at the northeast of `Leyndell Royal Capital` an as an NPC Invader after releasing **Dung Eater**'s corporeal body from his cell in the `Subterranean Shunning-Grounds` and then reading his message at the `Roundtable Hold`.

You can only get to this room after you have gained access to the Altus Plateau.\r\n- After showing the Dung Eater at least one `Seedbed Curse`, he will give you the `Sewer-Gaol Key`, which can be used to open his cell in the `Subterranean Shunning-Grounds`, beneath `Leyndell, Royal Capital`.\r\n- The Dung Eater can be found in his cell in the sewers and released from his prison by talking to him and telling him he's free to go. \n  \t- Spawn at the Underground Roadside grace \n    \t\t- Leave this room and take a left\r\n\t\t- Now head down the corridor and jump down the open grate\r\n\t\t- Run North and go past the giant poison plants and climb the ladder\r\n\t\t- Be wary of the giant hand in this room, behind it is the Gaol door with Dung Eater inside\r\n\t\t- Do not kill Dung Eater here if you want to complete his questline (Dung Eater's summon sign will then appear in-front of the fog wall to assist with `Mohg, The Omen`.\t\t\t- Dung Eater in his cell\r\n\t\t\t- ``\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n- Upon returning to Roundtable Hold, the Dung Eater will be missing, having left a message asking you to fight him at the outer moat. `Elden Ring Map here`. \n  \t- If doing `Blackguard Big Boggart's` questline, be sure to complete it before moving onto the next step, or else Big won't drop a Seedbed Curse.\r\n\t- Defeat the Dung Eater in this invasion and he drops the `Sword of Milos`.\r\n\t- Dung Eater in the Outer Moat \n    \t\t- ``\r\n \r\n \r\n- Upon defeating the Dung Eater at the moat he will return to Roundtable Hold. Talk to him and he will ask you to bring his real body more `Seedbed Curses`. His body can be found tied up in a chair in the same cell that he was released from before. \n  \t- You may interact with him to give `Seedbed Curses` to him.\r\n\t- Or alternatively you could give him `Seluvis's Potion`. This will allow you to get the `Dung Eater Puppet` summon from `Seluvis`. But this will end the Dung Eater quest and prevent you from getting the `Blessing of Despair` ending. \n    \t\t- **Tip**: You can give Dung Eater `Seluvis's Potion` and still get the `Omen Set` which is typically only obtainable have given him 5 `Seedbed Curses`. Just give him `Seluvis's Potion` while he's tied in the chair and once he passes out completely wait a moment or two and kill him. The `Omen set` will drop and he will still be offered as a puppet for purchase from `Seluvis`.\r\n\t\t- If you don't see him as a puppet for purchase at first, buy one puppet and some spells from `Seluvis` then go out and find another `starlight shard`. When you return to `Seluvis` he should now offer the `Dung Eater Puppet` for purchase along with progressing the `Seluvis` quest line.\r\n \r\n \r\n- After giving the Dung Eater 5 `Seedbed Curses`, his quest line will be complete and you will be rewarded the `Mending Rune of the Fell Curse`. \n  \t- Reload the area to find the `Omen Set` where he gave you the rune.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Dung Eater\r\nFirst Interaction while at Roundtable Hold.\r\n- *\"Have you ever felt the curse? With your whole being, the pox upon life itself. Feared and despised by all. The Reviled blessing.Apparently not. You are but a lamb. A stranger to defilement. Ignorant to your own ignorance. You no longer interest me.I've been long without peace. Don't spoil my quietude.\"*\r\n- *\"I asked you not to disturb me. Be thankful of the Hold's serenity.It is all that keeps your death and defilement at bay.\"*\r\nSpeaking to him at Roundtable Hold after collecting the first Seedbed.\r\n- *\"No. Wait.You have felt the curse. I can smell it on you, the pox yet tender.Apparently my Seedbed is ripe and waiting.It twas a brief respite I must say.Go and unshackle my corporeal fleshTrapped in the sewer-gaol below the capital.\"***\r\nAfter Recieving the Sewer-Gaol Key\r\n- *\"I can kill you and defile your corpse. **Then the pox will truly be your own.\"*\r\nBefore interacting with him in the Sewer-Gaol\r\n- *\"Let me out! Let me out of here!Must eat more! Defile more!Everything that matters to you!For generations to come!I am the Dung Eater!A scourge upon the living!\"*\r\nInteracting with him in the Sewer-Gaol\r\n- *\"Who are you?\"*\r\n- *\"Let me out. Let me out of here.\"*\r\nSaying nothing\r\n- *\"I am the Dung Eater.A scourge upon the living.I must eat more. Defile more...**\"*\r\nTelling him to leave the Gaol\r\n- *\"I've been here long enough.**I will kill again. And defile each corpse with care.Just to be sure. That when they're reborn...**They'll be cursed. **Along with their children, and their children's children, for all time to come...**\"*\r\nMessage left at the Roundtable Hold\r\n- *\"I'll defile you next. Come to the outer moat.\"*\r\nAfter his invasion\r\n- *\"There you are. You warded off my blessing. Despite the curse stirring within you.No one has succeeded in that before. How? I thought. Then it hit me.That you are, in fact, me. And I...am the Dung Eater. It is my flesh that must receive the blessing.\"*\r\n- *\"Give me your blessing. Defile my flesh with the seedbed curse.Again and again. Until it is done. Until a cursed ring coalesces, that may one day defile the Order itself.Countless, I have killed. And countless, I have defiled. And soon the fruits will be borne.Hundreds will be reborn cursed, and they'll bear thousands of cursed children, who'll bear tens of thousands more.A few of those will be born just like me, and they'll kill, and defile, and bless in my stead!The rotten fools. My fate was the grandest, most brilliant of them all!\"*\r\n- *\"My corporeal flesh lies in the sewer gaol beneath the Capital.Give it your blessing. Defile my flesh with the seedbed curse.Until a cursed ring coalesces, that may one day defile the Order itself.\"*\r\nAfter collecting 5 Seedbed Curses\r\n- *\"Uur...urgh... A curse... A curse upon them all.They'll be born cursed, all of them. Along with their children, and their children's children, heh, for all time to come...\"*\r\n- (If Seedbed Curses are used)* \"Unleash it upon them! A cursed blessing to all!*\r\n- (If Seluvis's Potion is used)* \"No... I am... the Dung Eater... I am...\"*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Dung Eater Notes & Trivia\r\n- In combat, Dung Eater wields the `Sword of Milos`.\r\n- `Roderika` will comment on Dung Eater when he arrives at `Roundtable Hold`. This happens when the player reaches the `Altus Plateau` for the first time.\t- *\"I can hear it from across the wing, past the roundtable ...The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of the curse. I can ever hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself. You should keep your distance, I know you're strong, but please.\"*\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"

    "mainContent": "**Gatekeeper Gostoc** is an `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. Gatekeeper Gostoc is an old tall fellow that may seem a bit suspicious, but he seems to want to help. It is your choice to trust him or not.\r\n \r\n### Gatekeeper Gostoc Location in Elden Ring\r\n- **Gatekeeper Gostoc **can be found by the entrance of `Stormveil Castle`, in the room next to the main gate into the castle. `Elden Ring Interactive Map Link`.\r\n- After defeating `Godrick`, Gostoc moves to the Godrick the Grafted Site of Grace, stomping on his remains.\r\n- If defeated, drops:\t- `Gostoc's Bell Bearing`\r\n\t- `Silver Pickled Fowl Foot`\r\n\t- `Glass Shard`\r\n \r\n \r\n### Gatekeeper Gostoc Questline: How to complete Gatekeeper Gostoc's Quest\r\nCastle Siege\r\n- Gatekeeper Gostoc advises you to avoid entering the castle using the main gate because he says it's tightly guarded. He suggests you to try the opening through the other way, claiming that guards don't know about that entrance. You will be given the choice to accept or reject his suggestion. \n  \t- If you accept the offer, he will wish you luck and send you on your way to the side path.\r\n\t- If you reject the offer, he will seemingly respect your decision and open the gate for you. \r\n \r\n- ****\r\n- Gostoc at first may seem to want to help the player, although in a suspicious manner. This is however just a facade. He will actually steal 30% of your runes every time you die in the castle, even if you enter it through the main gate.\r\n- After passing through specific trigger points, Gostoc will appear in certain locations behind the player. Gostoc can be found on a ruined watchtower while traversing through the side path, inside the rampart tower, and on the castle chapel roof, above `Sorcerer Rogier`. He will give you a `Grace Mimic` the first time you speak to him at one of these locations. He will not appear at them if you already opened the main gate of the castle.\r\n- When you enter a dark room containing the `Rusty Key`, the door will close behind you and you can hear Gostoc's laugh. This will leave you alone with a dangerous `Banished Knight`. \n  \t- If you kill Gostoc beforehand, you won't be locked into the room containing the Rusty Key.\r\n \r\n- After defeating Godrick, Gostoc will move to the boss room and begin stomping on the corpse, cursing Godrick for treating him badly. As of 1.04 he continues to be a merchant.\r\n- Killing Gostoc will not lock you out of `Nepheli Loux` and `Kenneth Haight`'s quest as it can still be completed without him, but you will miss out on the `Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone` and won't be able to buy it from the Twin Maiden Husks even if you gave them his bell bearing.\r\nNew Lord\r\n- Once `Nepheli Loux` has been given `The Stormhawk King`, `Kenneth Haight` has regained control of his fort and `Morgott` has been defeated then Gostoc and the other two NPCs will move the Godrick's Throne Room. At this point Gostoc re-opens his shop and has a new item of an `Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone`\r\n### Elden Ring Gatekeeper Gostoc Shop\r\n**Gatekeeper Gostoc** will open his store after you obtained the Rusty Key from `Stormveil Castle`.\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Gatekeeper Gostoc\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *\"You're Tarnished, aren't you?**I would advise against taking the main gate into the castle.**It's tightly guarded by hardened old hands.**Try the opening right here.**The guards don't know about it.**You'll breach the castle undetected.\"*\r\nAnswering with \"Very Well\"\r\n- *\"Yes, that's the spirit.**..You're just the kind of Tarnished that I like. **I pray for your success.\"*\r\nVisit\r\n- *I've come into some fine goods. Only, it turns out I can't use a one of them. Perhaps you'd like to take them off my hands?*\r\nWhen discovered by the player after surviving the trap with the Banished Knight, above the cliff behind the Stormveil Cliffside Site of Grace\r\n- *Oh, oh, you... Oh, great, I'm glad you're here. **Just a small reward, I was saving it for you. Please, its all yours.*\r\n- **Presents 1x Grace Mimic to the player**\r\nWhen spoken to again at this point\r\n- *Good, now let's be on our way, shall we? Wouldn't want the guards to spot you.*\r\nWhen spoken to once again at this point. \r\n- *Hop along, will you? What'll happen if the guards catch you strutting about?**.*\r\nIf the player dies to the trap, Gostoc will not appear in this spot after reviving. Instead, his encounter dialogue from this event will take place in another location.\r\nThe Death of Godrick\r\n-  *What a pathetic excuse for a Lord you were. Craven to the bone. Pushing me about like that. And after all that grafting? Where did that get you? Look down on me, would you? Godrick? You filthy slug. Feel it! Feel it! Feel my bloody wrath!*\r\n *Oh...hello there. This weasel was...Godrick was always looking down on me. He got what he bloody deserved, thanks to you. I tell you though, what goes around comes around. He had an ugly heart, an uglier countenance, and me the ugliest of ends, eh. He he he he he...Now, I supposed I'm free. I can do whatever takes my fancy...Can't I, mate? *\r\n \r\nSmall Talk\r\n- *\"Use that opening to breach the castle. **The guards haven't a clue about it. **You'll slip right inside undetected.\"*\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- *\"Blast, what's it to you! Step back, you wretched Tarnished!\"*\r\n- (On player kill) *\"Oh, don't worry, I've got big plans for what's left of you...\"*\r\nWhen Killed\r\n- *\"Damn it all.  Why is it always me?  What did I do to deserve...\"*\r\nWhen Killed after Godrick is dead\r\n- *\"But I'm free...\"\"I can do what I like\"*\r\nWhen Gostoc kills the player after Godrick is dead\r\n- *\"Ha, do you feel it...\"\"Do you feel my bloody wrath?\"*\r\nStormveil Castle Throne Room, after `Nepheli Loux` and `Kenneth Haight` have moved there\r\n- *\"Ah, you, is it? Haven't seen your mug in quite some time.As you can see, I'm the new Lady's attendant.**Freedom? Wasn't worth squat. B-besides, I like it 'round 'ere...**Lady Nepheli's still fair of heart and countenance...\"*\r\n- *\"Still, I have the Lady's trust.**...So I can loot all the corpses I like.**I'll let you take a look at the goods, if you fancy.\"*\r\n- *\"Ah, back again, are we? Curious one, you are.**Well then, what are you after?\"*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Notes & Trivia for Gatekeeper Gostoc\r\n- Gostoc being found hiding at difficult to access locations around the castle suggests he is stalking you to collect your runes after you die. He also presumably collects his goods from corpses in the fortress. \r\n- Cut dialogue suggested that he is the son of Godrick, and that there was an option to crown him as Ruler of Stormveil, instead of `Nepheli`.\r\n- Killing the Banished Knight in the dark room before being locked in by Gostoc will result in him not closing the door behind you once you do enter, although you will still hear him laughing behind you.\r\n- Gatekeeper Gostoc is missing his left hand. Removal of one or both hands was a historical punishment for stealing. His arm may have also been taken for Grafting.\r\n- The graveyard after the fight with Godrick counts as castle grounds and he will steal your runes here as well.\r\n \r\n"

    "mainContent": "**Ranni the Witch** is an `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. **Ranni the Witch** is a mysterious figure who first introduces herself as `Renna`. Upon meeting her again at `Three Sisters`, she reveals her true name and eventually will recruit you into her servitude, sending you off in search of a hidden treasure. This page covers vital information for Ranni's questline for `Elden Ring`.\r\n \r\nRanni is the daughter of `Radagon` and `Rennala`. After Radagon departed and became the consort to Marika, Ranni and her siblings were raised to demigod status, as they were now the children of the consort of a goddess. She appears to have some involvement in The Night of Black Knives, where Black Knife Assassins stole a shard of the Rune of Death and murdered Godwyn, the Golden. At the same time, Ranni seems to have lost her original body and now resides as spirit inhabiting an artificial doll body, seeking to restore her Empyrean status with the aid of blacksmith Iji, preceptor Seluvis, wolf warrior Blaidd, and the Tarnished.\r\n \r\n### Ranni the Witch Location in Elden Ring\r\nRanni the Witch can be found at `Ranni's Rise` in the `Three Sisters` sub-region of `Liurnia of the Lakes` for a majority of her questline.\r\n \r\n### Ranni the Witch Questline: How to Complete Ranni's Quest in Elden Ring\r\n- Ranni is first encountered going by the name `Renna` at night in the `Church of Elleh` early on, after you have met Melina and acquired Torrent. However, she will not appear unless you have died at least once after leaving the Precipice of Anticipation. Once she has arrived, she will call out to the player to approach and speak with them. Upon doing so and answering her quaestion in the affirmative, she will gift the player with the Spirit Calling Bell and the Lone Wolf Ashes. She will then disappear after being spoken to again or after walking far enough away from her. [`Elden Ring Map Link`]\r\n- If the player somehow misses their first encounter with Ranni, this will not prevent her quest from being completed. She can next be found in the `Liurnia` region, at the top of `Ranni's Rise`. To access the area where Ranni's Rise resides, you must defeat `Royal Knight Loretta` at the Caria Manor.\r\n- If her initial encounter is missed, where she gifts the player the `Spirit Calling Bell` and Lone Wolf Ashes, both can then be found at and purchased from the `Twin Maiden Husks` at the Roundtable Hold.\r\n- Please note, Ranni will not appear in the Ranni's Rise for the next step of her quest line if the Radahn Festival has already started at Castle Redmane (the Radahn Festival begins outside of Ranni's quest line progression if you have either activated the Grand Lift of Dectus or activated any Sites of Grace found within the Altus Plateau). This is because Blaidd is required to continue her quest line and he will not leave the Radahn Festival until General Radahn has been defeated. Once General Radahn has been defeated, Ranni will reappear at Ranni's Rise and her quest line can be continued from then on.\r\n- Ranni is later found in `Liurnia` atop `Ranni's Rise`. She tasks the player with finding the hidden treasure of Nokron and asks that you speak with three people in her service: `War Counselor Iji`, Half-Wolf Warrior `Blaidd`, and Preceptor `Seluvis`. The three will then appear as spectral projections within her tower that can be spoken with. \n  \t- The player will be unable to leave the tower area until all three people have been spoken with and their dialogue exhausted (a fog wall barrier will physically block the player from leaving the area by foot/hoof and fast travel will be disabled). After speaking to the three, returning to Ranni and speaking with her will have her reveal that she is going to fall into a deep slumber soon and will not be able to speak with the player for some time. Once you are finished speaking with Ranni, you will be able to leave the area and fast travel again as normal. \r\n\t- Upon first meeting her at Ranni's Rise, if she tells you to begone after mentioning the curse mark on her discarded body and won't recruit you into her service, you will need to return to `Rogier` at the Roundtable Hold and speak with him. He will suggest that you join into her service in order to learn more about where her curse mark could be found. You can then return to Ranni and speak with her to continue her quest line.\r\n \r\n- Blaidd will be waiting in the `Siofra River` area (travel east from the Siofra River Bank Site of Grace until you reach the area where a Spirit Spring can be found, Blaidd will be standing nearby, however, be sure to defeat any enemies nearby as they can persue you and cause issues with speaking with Blaidd). He will reveal that he suspects that `Preceptor Seluvis`` `knows more than he lets on and suggests that you go and speak with him. Upon speaking with Seluvis, he will inform you that `Sorceress Sellen` might have some information as to how to enter Nokron, and then provides you with `Seluvis's Introduction` to show her. Upon speaking with Sellen at the Waypoint Ruins and showing her Seluvis's Introduction, she informs the player that `Starscourge Radahn` has used his power to stop the movement of the stars, and that the only way to restore their movement and find an entrance into Nokron is to slay him. \n  \t- Please note, if the player was unable to tolerate his \"pleasant demeanor\" and has killed Preceptor Seluvis, Blaidd will be hostile to you, and cause Ranni's quest line to halt until the player seeks Absolution at the Church of Vows.\r\n \r\n- Once Radahn has been slain, the stars will be freed to continue their flight, with one of them landing somewhere nearby. Returning to Iji and speaking with him reveals that the fallen star struck Limgrave (the site is south of `Mistwood`, fairly close to the ruins where the player could have first met Blaidd) and has created a new entrance into Nokron. Travelling to Limgrave, the landing site is hard to miss, as gravity magic from the fallen star has caused large chunks of rock to become permanently suspended in the air above the landing site. By carefully making their way down, the player can reach the city of Nokron. To reach the section of the city that holds the treasure Ranni wants, you must push through until you reach the Ancestral Woods Site of Grace and then jump across the nearby ledge and back into the city. Continue onward into the city and you will eventually find a treasure chest containing the `Fingerslayer Blade`, the secret treasure of Nokron that Ranni seeks.\r\n- Please note, giving Ranni the Fingerslayer Blade will cause Preceptor Seluvis to become a lifeless puppet. If you want to get the Magic Scorpion Charm from him in this playthrough, you need to start and/or continue through his quest line until he gifts the amulet to you, before giving Ranni the Fingerslayer Blade. After recieving the Magic Scorpion Charm, you may safely carry on with Ranni's quest line. If Seluvis has given you the Amber Draught to give to Ranni at this point, once you have the Fingerslayer Blade you will no longer have the option to give the Amber Draught to Ranni. Honestly though, it isn't a loss if you lose the option to give her the Amber Draught, as you aren't rewarded with anything for trying to give Ranni the Amber Draught, as it doesn't work on her and only serves to make her disappointed with you and halt her quest line until you seek Absolution at the Church of Vows.\r\n- Upon returning to Ranni and giving her the Fingerslayer Blade to Ranni, she will reward the player with the Carian Inverted Statue, which they can use at the pedestal at the entrance to the Carian Study Hall to reach the top of the Divine Tower of Liurnia. After speaking with her, Ranni will leave to continue her quest alone. Upon arriving at the top of the Divine Tower of Liurnia, you will be able to find the Cursemark of Death upon the remains of Ranni's original body, which is severely burnt.\r\n- After giving the Fingerslayer Blade to Ranni, you can speak with Iji, and he will tell you where Ranni has gone (mentioning Renna's Rise in the process) and the Carian Filigreed Crest will be added to his merchant inventory for purchase, if you had yet to unlock its availability.\r\n- At this point, the seal blocking access to `Renna's Rise` will have vanished, allowing access insode the tower. Upon reaching the top of the ladder within, you can find a chest containing the Snow Witch Set that Ranni wore. Upon reaching the top of the tower, you can find a waygate that will transport you to `Ainsel River Main`, where you can loot a `Miniature Ranni` doll nearby. After acquiring thee doll, rest at the Ainsel River Main Site of Grace. You will see a new option listed amongst the others, that being \"Talk to miniature Ranni.\" Select this option three times and Ranni will speak to you revealing that Ranni has possessed the doll. Annoyed at your interference, she will then task the player with defeating the `Baleful Shadow` found further into the area. The Baleful Shadow can be found just beyond the `Nokstella Waterfall Basin` Site of Grace in `Nokstella, Eternal City`. They are an agile and fairly strong opponent, so take caustion when fighting them. After defeating the Baleful Shadow, Ranni will thank the player and reward them with the `Discarded Palace Key`. Ranni will then say farewell as she still has things to do, her spirit leaving the doll.\r\n- You are able to use the Discarded Palace Key to unlock the chest found in the Raya Lucaria Grand Library next to `Rennala`. Inside you will find the `Dark Moon Ring`. With this ring in hand, travel back to the `Lake of Rot` in the `Ainsel River` area, and continue onward into the `Grand Cloister`.\r\n- By interacting with the stone coffin in the Grand Cloister (you can interact with it from a distance so that you do not have to stand in the Scarlet Rot water), the player can access a new area where they can find and defeat `Astel, Naturalborn of the Void`. After their defeat, a new exit path can be traversed through (without having the Dark Moon Ring, an impassable magic seal blocks this exit). This path allows access to the southernmost section of Liurnia, the `Moonlight Altar`. Your next destination is the nearby `Cathedral of Manus Celes`. After collecting the 10 Starlight Shards scattered about, drop down the hole near the Site of Grace and continue throught the tunnel until you reach a recent battle site, where Ranni's naked, broken doll body can be found. \n  \t- Please note, `Glintstone Dragon Adula` will suddenly materialize near the Cathedral of Manus Celes, regardless of whether or not the dragon was forced to retreat at `Three Sisters`, so take caution when exploring the area.\r\n \r\n- Interact with Ranni's doll body to place the Dark Moon Ring on Ranni's finger. Her doll body will then disappear and Ranni, fully restored to her previous life-sized doll form, will appear and thank the player. She confims that the player is now her consort, and promises that they will meet again. After Ranni vanishes, an item will appear where she once stood. Loot the item to acquire the `Dark Moon Greatsword`.\r\n- Provided Ranni's quest line has been completed, after defeating the Elden Beast, a blue summon sign will appear on the ground near Marika's broken remains. The player can interact with this summon sign (instead of interacting with Marika's remains) to acquire the \"Age of the Stars\" ending. Doing so will also unlock a related game achievement/trophy.\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Ranni the Witch\r\nMeeting at Church of Elleh\r\n- *This way, Tarnished.**May I have a word?A pleasure to meet thee, Tarnished.I am the witch Renna.I'd heard tell of a Tarnished hurtling about atop a spectral steed.And upon looking into the matter, the talk, I surmise, is of thee.Thou'rt posesssed of the power, no?**To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent.*\r\nI can call the spectral steed\r\n- *Ah. As I had hoped.I was entrusted this, for thee.**By Torrent's former master.'Tis a bell for calling forth spirits.**Summon them with it, from ash unreturned to the Erdtree.The spirits will obey thine command but briefly, as they recall battles past.**Now it is thine. To do with as thou wishest.*\r\n- *Forgive mine intrusion, Tarnished.**I doubt we shall again meet. But all the same, learn well the Lands Between.**How long will it be, I wonder...**Before the Tarnished tire of obesiance to the Two Fingers?*\r\nUpon defeating Rennala's first phase in Raya Lucaria Academy**\r\n- *Upon my name as Ranni the Witch.**Mother's rich slumber shall not be disturbed by thee.**Foul trespasser.**Send word far and wide.**Of the last Queen of Caria, Rennala of the Full Moon.**And the majesty of the night she conjureth.*\r\nMeeting at Ranni's Rise \r\n- *Oh, again we cross paths.**I believe I said my name was Renna, when last we met.**It pleaseth me to see Torrent hale and hearty...**But Tarnished, what business hast thou here?**I have no memory of inking thee an invitation.*\r\nYou must be Ranni the Witch, behind the Night of the Black Knives\r\n- *I see. Quite the sleuth, aren't we.**Indeed, I am the witch Ranni.**I stole a fragment of the Rune of Death, and used it to forge the godslaying black knives through fearsome rite.**I did it all.**But sadly for thee, the cursemark thou seekest is not to be found here.**I have slain the body I was born into, and cast it away.**And it is upon that flesh the cursemark is carved.*\r\nWhere did the body go?\r\n- *And why should I reveal that to thee?**I performed the act not to bury the past, nor in shame of the deed,**But all the same, the begging compels me not a jot.**The cursermark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say.**Now, begone.*\r\nI wish to serve you\r\n- *Oh, is that so?**Thou wouldst render me aid, is that thy proposal?**Affording thyself opportunity to grope about for the cursemark's location, no doubt?**Very well...**There's nothing wrong with a well-laid scheme.**What's more, if my past and past wounds beckon to thee,**I am curious enough to see what thy destiny portends...**I'll allow it. Enter my service.**And good hunting to thee.*\r\n- *Good, then I ask we proceed with haste.**There is, in my service, a half-wolven warrior by the name of Blaidd.**I would have thee join him in searching for the hidden treasure of Nokron, the Eternal City.**I have called for Blaidd to greet thee below. Take from him the particulars.**Ah, and there wilt thou find Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, also.**Heed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst.**I am sure the others will be doing just the same.*\r\n- *Speak with the three who await thee below.**Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth.**It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all.*\r\n- *Ah, allow me to forewarn thee.**I shall soon enter my slumber.**And it will be some time before I wake.**This doll's body is not without its hindrances...**Still, I have high hopes for thee.**I look forward to the good news when I arise.*\r\nNo particular reason\r\n- *No reason in particular, thou claimest?Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this reunion.Wilt thou enter into my service?I am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path.That I might one day upend the whole of it, and rid the world of all that came before.Well? Has that roused thy interest?*\r\nServe Ranni the Witch\r\n- *Thou'rt a rare sort. Not many would have accepted the offer.But I require as much of those under my command.I anticipate good work from thee.*\r\n- *[same as \"I wish to serve you\"]*\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- *What hopest thou to profit?*\r\n- *To think such was thy plot. Well, I refuse to indulge thy fantasies. I relinquished a natural death long, long ago.*\r\nAdminister Amber Draught (Seluvis' quest)\r\n- *Well, this is a most unpleasant awakening.The depths of wickedness never fail to surprise me.I am saddened. That thou wouldst succumb to such depravity.Led astray by Seluvis, with devious tonic in hand.Didst thou think to have thy way with me?Be gone. Hapless scum.I won't have another whiff of thy rotten breath.*\r\n- *I have spoken. Away from my sight.*\r\n- *This is the third time, fiend.Enough of thy unbearable breath.*\r\nGiving Ranni the Fingerslayer Blade\r\n- *Ahh...It was thee. Not Blaidd, it seemeth. Even in my slumber, I sensed it.**It is in thy possession, is it not? The hidden treasure of Nokron?**My thanks. Finally, all the pieces are in place.**Soon must I begin my journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.*\r\n- *Ah, but before I leave, I shall entrust thee with this.*\r\n- *My thanks, for thy sterling efforts.**A strange gift, perhaps, but a rare sort such as thee would welcome it, I am sure.**I am certain now, fate steered us to our reunion.**I must thank Torrent too, for his part. **You may leave now. It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service.*\r\n- *What is it? You may go.**I, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.*\r\nWhen speaking to Miniature Ranni at the Ainsel River Main Site of Grace\r\n- *Oh? A dogged fellow, aren't we?**Or is it merely thy habit, to talk to dolls?**Fine...fine.**I hadn't expected any soul to recognize me in this guise.**But now the cat is out the bag, I cannot allow thee thy freedoms.**Perform for me a service, as recompense.**Eliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands.**The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee.**I will not brook disobedience in this matter.*\r\n- *Let us speak of the past, a while.**I was once an Empyrean.**Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title.**Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age. Which is when I received Blaidd. In the form of a vassal tailored for an Empyrean.**But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers.**I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away.**I would not be controlled by that thing.**The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since... And the Baleful Shadows... are their assassins.*\r\n- *I turned my back on the Two Fingers and we each have been cursing the other since. The Baleful Shadows... are their assassins.*\r\nWhen speaking to Ranni at the Nokstella Waterfall Basin Site of Grace\r\n- *Even when I turned my back upon the Two Fingers.**Blaidd remained my loyal ally.**Heh. Though he was created a vassal for an Empyrean,**He was a colossal failure, on the part of the Two Fingers.**Blaidd, and Iji both... Art willing to give too much to me.**Yet they both understand. What lieth beyond the dark path...**That I must betray everything, and rid the world of what came before.**Ah, should I add thee to the list?**Another one, kind of heart. As kind of heart as they.*\r\n- *Ach, this form hath loosened my tongue.**I've let slip too much.**Forget what thou'st heard. Forget.*\r\nAfter using the Dark Moon Ring\r\n- *So, it was thee, who would become my Lord.Perhaps I needn't have warned thee.I am pleased, however. Thou'rt a fitting choice.I go now, to the night sky. It is there I shall find mine order.I bid thee travel the path of the Lord.And once all is done, we shall see each other, once more.*\r\nAttacking her after using the Dark Moon Ring\r\n- *What hopest thou to profit?*\r\n- *Hmph. So, this is the measure of my Lord? Perhaps it is precisely what I deserve. ...For surrendering myself to delusion.*\r\nUpon speaking to Miniature Ranni at her chambers Site of Grace after finishing her questline.\r\n- *I take it thou'st noticed? I shouldn't be surprised. **I thought I might expound a little further... Upon the order I envision.*\r\n- *Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night. **I would keep them far from the earth beneath our feet. As it is now, life, and souls, and order are bound tightly together, but would have them at great remove.*\r\n- *And have the certainties of sight, emotion, faith, and touch... All become impossibilities. **Which is why I would abandon this soil, with mine order. **Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only lord?*\r\n\"Age of Stars\" ending cutscene.\r\n- *...The battle is over, I see.*\r\n- *To every living being, and every living soul. **Now cometh the age of the stars. A thousand year voyage under the wisdom of the Moon**Here beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond. Into fear, doubt, and loneliness... As the path stretcheth into darkness.*\r\n- *Well then. Shall we? My dear consort, eternal.*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Ranni the Witch Notes & Trivia\r\n- She is the daughter of Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, and Radagon, as well as the only daughter the two had while together.\r\n- Ranni's body was willingly slain along with Godwyn's soul (unwillingly) on the Night of the Black Knives, leading to Ranni binding her soul to a life-sized doll, modeled in the likeness of her former mentor.\r\n- Ranni is one of the Empyreans chosen by the Two Fingers. \n  \t- Ranni, unlike the other Empyreans, sought to free herself and her fate from the influence of the Two Fingers. With the help of the Tarnished she eventually killed the specific Two Fingers entity that held ssway over her fate under the Cathedral of Manus Celus, using the Fingerslayer Blade, a weapon that was designed specifically to slay those of the Two Fingers.\r\n \r\n- Blaidd is Ranni's Empyrean shadow and adopted half-brother, gifted to her by the Two Fingers, just as Maliketh was for Marika.\r\n- Coincidentally, Ranni falls into a deep slumber at about the same time as Sorcerer Rogier.\r\n- After completing her quest line, a new `Site of Grace` called \"Ranni's Rise\" will appear at the top of Ranni's Rise [`Elden Ring Map Link`]. While resting at that Site of Grace, you have the option to speak to the `Miniature Ranni`. Doing so will have Ranni's spirit explain the details of her plan and her intentions for the world. Hearing this dialogue will change the way Ranni addresses you in the Age of Stars ending, from \"**Fair** Consort\" to \"**Dear** Consort\".\r\n- It has at one point been speculated that Ranni's dialogue during the Age of Stars ending was mistranslated. In the english script, Ranni states that her age will be that of the chill night, and that she wishes to make the certainties of sight, touch, faith and emotion become impossibilities. However, in the Japanese script, Ranni states that she wishes to take the chill night away, she doesn't say that she wishes to take away emotions and sensations, but that she wants to take her order and herself far away from the world. She believes that the world is better off if the order that people live within is so far away that it is not something that can be seen, touched, or worshipped. To do so, she will leave the world along with her new order, preventing either from interfering with the Lands Between and those that reside there as its ordained god, unlike Marika under the influence of the Two Fingers and the Greater Will. Please note, however, this may just be a difference in phrasing and not really a mistranslation, as both versions of the script mean mostly the same thing, but have a slightly different tone.\r\n- Some speculate that Ranni is the Gloam-Eyed Queen of the Godskin Apostles, but as of yet there is no reasonable evidence to prove as such. However, she is almost certainly associated with the Black Knife Assassins.\r\n- Some speculate that Ranni and Melina have some sort of close connection, as both are spirits who lost their former bodies and both have opposing eye seals, a trait not seen in any other characters. However, given that Ranni's current doll body (and thus perhaps her eye seal) is based on her former mentor, the old snow witch, it might be that the old snow witch is the one with a connection to Melina, not Ranni.\r\n- Ranni's doll body shares a similarity with the Marionette enemies found throughout the Lands Between that appear to also have come from Liurnia, in that they both were built to have four arms.\r\n- If Ranni is attacked after giving her Dark Moon Ring in front of the slayed two finger, she will have a protective barrier, give some dialogue about it being what she deserved for surrounding herself with delusions and then disappear. (`Blaidd` will still appear Feral and you will be able to obtain his armor and weapon.). Using `Celestial Dew` to atone, will bring Ranni back to her position below the Church (in front of the slain two fingers)\r\n- If you read the description of the Dark Moon Greatsword, it reveals that swords such as it were created to be given to the betrothed of the Carian queen, as is tradition. Given this, had Ranni become the queen of Caria, Ranni's betrothed would have given her the Dark Moon Ring and Ranni would have given them the Dark Moon Greatsword in return upon the day of their betrothal.\r\n- It appears that Ranni's great rune symbol is etched upon the surface of the moon. What connotations this has have yet to be revealed.\r\n- Ranni likely had a close connection (besides being siblings) with Praetor Rykard at some point in the past, given this part of the description of the Blasphemous Blade tool item \"On the night of the dire plot, Ranni rewarded Praetor Rykard with these traces. Should the coming trespass one day transpire, they would serve as a last-resort foil, allowing Rykard to challenge Maliketh the Black Blade, the black beast of Destined Death.\" This trust in him may be tied to his utter disdain and rejection of the Erdtree and the Two Fingers, which he later acted upon during the events of The Shattering. Allowing himself to be devoured by the great sperpent of sin and thus become one with it.\r\n \r\n"

    "mainContent": "**Preceptor Seluvis** is an `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. **Seluvis** is a pompous sorcerer in service to `Ranni the Witch`. He is first encountered in spectral form at `Ranni's Rise` in the `Three Sisters` sub-region of `Liurnia of the Lakes`.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Preceptor Seluvis Location in Elden Ring\r\n**Preceptor Seluvis** is found in various locations:\r\n1. Seluvis is initially spoken to in spectral form at `Ranni's Rise`. [`Map Link`]\r\n1. He can then be found in physical form at `Seluvis's Rise`. [`Map Link`]\r\n \r\n- This NPC does not move\r\n- This merchant can't be fought\r\n- Upon death, drops: \n  \t- `Preceptor's Set`\r\n\t- `Seluvis's Bell Bearing`\r\n \r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Preceptor Seluvis Shop\r\nAfter completing his first quest, he will become available as a merchant.\r\n \r\n### Preceptor Seluvis Questline: How to complete Precetor Seluvis' Quest\r\n- Seluvis appears in spectral form on the ground floor of `Ranni's Rise` after speaking to `Ranni` for the first time.\r\n- He asks you, out of courtesy, to meet him physically at his tower nearby.\r\n-  At `Seluvis's Rise`, he hands you `Seluvis's Potion` and tasks you with finding `Nepheli Loux` and having her drink it.With the potion, there are two major paths to take: \n  1. Talk with `Gideon Ofnir` and discuss Seluvis' plan. He will offer to dispose of the potion, claiming that Seluvis will be none the wiser. Alternatively, you can instead keep the potion and hand it over to Nepheli.\r\n1. Feed it to `Dung Eater`. If the player has made progress in his questline to the point in which he is bound to a chair and accepting `Seedbed Curse`, it is possible to feed him the potion and return to Seluvis. He will have a new dialogue option then.\r\n \r\n- **If someone had been fed the potion**, they can then be found in Seluvis' laboratory and their respective `Ashes` made available. \r\n- Regardless of your decision, Seluvis' response will be the same. \n  \t- **NOTE:** With only a single potion, you must make a choice between Nepheli's or Dung Eater's ashes in a given playthrough. Obtaining the other will require New Game+.\r\n \r\n- Note: You must complete this before  the `Fingerslayer Blade`. Ranni will immediately go into dialog about it upon pickup and you will not have an opportunity to complete this section of his quest.\r\n- Locating Seluvis' hidden chambers in the ruins outside of Ranni's Rise and interacting with the message within will allow you to ask Seluvis about them. They are hidden beneath an illusory floor.\r\n- When asked about his chambers, he will let you purchase one of his puppet `Spirit Ashes` in exchange for `Starlight Shards`.\r\n- After purchasing all of his available `Sorceries` and one of the puppets, he will tell you of his plot. \n  \t- **NOTE**: If you have already completed his previous quest and accepted one of his puppets and yet Seluvis won't open his puppet shop, either go acquire another Starlight Shard, or drop one from your inventory and pick it up again. Alternatively,  you can save and quit to reload the area. He should then offer the dialog option to buy more puppets.\r\n\t- **NOTE**: As of 04/13/2022, I had to buy all sorceries and both puppets available at the time from Seluvis for his 'About the scheme' dialogue to become available.\r\n \r\n- He seeks to create a potion that will turn even a demigod into a puppet. To make it, he asks you to acquire an `Amber Starlight` shard which can found at the `Altus Plateau`. `Pidia, Carian Servant` sells a `Weathered Map` to help deduce its exact location.\r\n- Handing over the shard will reward you with the `Magic Scorpion Charm`. \n  \t- **NOTE**: For sake of clarity, you can stop here with the talisman and safely continue with Ranni's questline. Attacking him though will result in Ranni's other followers becoming hostile despite him attempting to betray Ranni.\r\n \r\n- After reloading the area he will hand you the `Amber Draught` and ask you to administer it to Ranni.\r\n- Upon doing so, she will wake up, seemingly unaffected by the potion and is both saddened and outraged by your actions. Exhausting Ranni's dialogue will lead to her killing you and Seluvis. Seluvis body can then be found at his tower with Ranni and Iji disappearing from the area. \n  \t- **NOTE**: You can absolve yourself with a `Celestial Dew` at the `Church of Vows` and continue Ranni's questline without consequence.\r\n \r\n- After giving the `Fingerslayer Blade` to Ranni, Seluvis can then be found at `Seluvis's Rise`, dead. Thus ending his questline.\r\n- The end of his questline is synced with `Pidia, Carian Servant`'s. Before the questline ends, Pidia expresses shock that his puppets that he loved so dearly would betray him. \n  \t- Nepheli's Puppet Ashes will drop instead of Delores' Puppet Ashes from Pidia's corpse if she was given the potion.\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Preceptor Seluvis Secondary Shop (Puppet Ashes)\r\nSeluvis' puppet laboratory is located in one of the ruins near his tower. From Ranni's Rise Site of Grace, head outside and visit the first set of ruins on your left. Striking the floor will reveal an illusory floor and a staircase.Inside will be a message: \"*Seluvis' puppet. Do not touch.*\" After confronting him about the laboratory and exhausting his dialogue, he will offer you one of his puppets. You can now exchange `Starlight Shards` for other available Ashes.\r\n**NOTE: **If Seluvis has died due to progress in Ranni's questline, it is still possible to purchase from this shop. Simply return to his dead body and a prompt will appear.**NOTE 2: **Alternatively Delores' Puppet Ashes will drop from Pidia if the potion is given to Dung Eater, however you will not get Nepheli's Puppet Ashes from Pidia by doing so. (**Nepheli's Puppet Ashes are not purchasable in the shop**)\r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Preceptor Seluvis\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *I see... You must be `Ranni`'s new hireling.**Yes, yes, I've heard all about you.**I am Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts.**I don't know what it is the mistress sees in a provincial Tarnished like you,**but since we have the misfortune of serving the same Lady,**I ask that you kindly try not to drag us all down with you.*\r\n- *I reside...in another tower, close by.**Come and pay me a visit...**Should you wish to be of actual service to Mistress Ranni.**If it were up to me, I wouldn't waste my time on the likes of you.**But who am I to stand against the wishes of my Lady?*\r\nVisit\r\n- *Well, well. You took me at my word.**Did you not realise I was merely being polite? You provincials never cease to amaze...**Hmm, I suppose you're here now.**Perhaps I'll give you something to do.**I'd like you to find a woman called `Nepheli`, to administer a potion.**Even you can do that much, can't you?**[Accept the task]**Good, good.**Now I shall hand over the potion in question.**[Receives `Seluvis's Potion`]**Find `Nepheli`, and ensure she drinks it.**I except glad tidings. And soon.*\r\nAbout Nokron\r\n- *Well, well. You're asking me about that, are you?**The task was left to you and the mongrel, was it not?Not only are you incompetent, but shameless to boot.Well...there's no helping it.Now's as good a time as any. I'll let you in on it.There's a glintstone sorcerer by the name of Sellen in Limgrave.She owes me for the help I gave her when she was expelled from the academy.I asked her to look into the matter some time ago.I'll write you a letter of introduction. Go ask her.*[Gives `Seluvis's Introduction`]\r\nAfter giving someone Seluvis's Potion\r\n- *Ahh, so you made Nepheli drink the potion?Well done. You are a touch more useful than I had thought.Very well. Then you shall have your gift.Knowledge of the sorcerous arts, under the tutelage of the great Preceptor Seluvis.I doubt much of it will lay within the grasp of a mere Tarnished, but...If you put your mind to it, perhaps you won't embarrass our Lady.*\r\n- *You wish to begin right this moment?Well, your impatience, though boorish, is understandable. Let's have at it.*\r\nHand over the scroll\r\n- *Hmm. Is that a scroll?**I won't bother to ask where you pilfered it, but...**You're correct to assume I'm one of the few who can decipher it.So, I'm perfectly happy to take it off your hands.That said, don't you dare get your hopes up.More often than not, new knowledge is merely an opportunity to reflect......upon the mediocrity of one's intellect.*\r\nAbout Nepheli\r\n- *So, you had Nepheli drink the potion? Truly?**Hmm. Then perhaps something was amiss with it.It's concocted from the finest ingredients. But perhaps I should review the recipe.I may have expected too much of her, to begin with.*\r\nAbout your chambers\r\n- *You break into a man's private chambers, rooting about as you please?**Your oafishness knows no bounds.**Fine and well.You tricked Nepheli, and had her drink the potion.I believe that makes you my accomplice.You yearn for a puppet of your own, hmm?Well, normally one of your stature would never be allowed.But perhaps I can make a very special exception.Now, choose.*[Offers choice between `Finger Maiden Therolina Puppet` and `Jarwight Puppet`]\r\n- (Upon returning) *How's the puppet I gave you? A thing of exquisite craft, is it not?*\r\nI want a new puppet (after accepting the free puppet and finding more `Starlight Shards`)\r\n- *What's that? You want another puppet?**Quite the keen paramour, aren't we.**But, I'm afraid each and every one is like a child to me.I can hardly just give them away.Oh dear, what's to be done?Why don't you...fetch me some starlight shards?If you can manage it, I'll gladly prepare a new puppet for you.The soul of every puppet has its own ambience. You'll soon come to know, once you possess a few.And once each's predilections are known to you, the better you'll be able to love them.Oh yes, you have much to look forward to, further down this road.*[Opens puppet shop]\r\nAfter purchasing another puppet\r\n- *You're proving to be quite the puppeteer.**I've not had an apprentice for...a very long time indeed.*\r\nAbout the scheme\r\n- *Perhaps, you'd be interested in a little scheme of mine?**It will produce the finest of puppets.Which I aspire to cherish with these very hands.A ploy to fool even Lady Ranni... How does that sound?*\r\n- [I'm interested]* Ahh, I knew I had you pegged.You're just like me.Then I'd like you to procure something.A rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber.With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness.And even a demigod would be slave to its charms...*\r\nAbout Amber Starlight\r\n- *Procure it for me.The rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber.With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness.*And even a demigod would be slave to its charms...**\r\nGive Amber Starlight\r\n- *Well, well, you managed to lay your hands on it!The blessed day is finally upon us...Goodness gracious, the way it glistens...utterly enchanting.To think, this was once a demigod's very fate...My oh my oh my....*\r\n- *Ah, are you still here?Oh yes, I should give you your reward.Please, it's all yours. Splendid work. Just marvellous.*[Gives `Magic Scorpion Charm`]\r\n- *Now, just you wait. The merriment is soon to begin.The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly...*\r\n- (Talk again without reloading the area) *You'll be flabbergasted, I can assure you.**The secret* I promised is to be revealed very shortly...**He says \"The secret\" here, yet the subtitles repeat \"The scheme\" as in the previous line.\r\nReturning to Seluvis\r\n- *Good, I've been waiting for you.It's finally complete. The perfection of my draught, gleaming nectar-sweet.Give it to Ranni and ensure she drinks it.*[Gives `Amber Draught`]\r\n- *The dead-eyed doll lets down her guard in your presence, rather remarkably.Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona...she's a frail, gentle girl at heart.*\r\nAbout the draught\r\n- *You...understand, don't you?That once you have Ranni drink my draught, my scheme will come to fruition.And we, well, we'll be in a position to claim the very finest puppet ever crafted.Just imagine...the pure elation...*\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- *Agh! Enough of that, now. Have you forgotten that we both serve the same Lady?*\r\n- *You incorrigible lout. Don't you dare waltz back here again.*\r\nOther\r\n- *I have no time for idle chit chat. The only thing I will hear from you is a report of your task's completion. Are we understood? Then off you trot.*\r\n- *Begging for another lesson so soon? There remains much to be done. Make it quick.*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Preceptor Seluvis Notes & Trivia\r\n- Gideon and Seluvis seem to have a long-standing hatred, if not rivalry, for each other.\r\n- In between Ranni's Rise and Renna's Rise, you'll see a ruined building and a set of stairs that go down hidden by an illusory flooring, protected by a Noble Sorcerer who is otherwise invisible unless close by. \n  \t- There are many doll-like figures around the basement, with a message saying \"Seluvis' puppet. Do not touch.\" in the corner by a man with a jar for a head. Scary thing is that puppets' eyes are following player's movements. \n    \t\t- After giving his potion to either Gideon, Nepehli, or Dung Eater, speaking to Seluvis about his basement will become available, in which he will give you access to one free Spirit Ash summon, with the other two available for purchase later. \n      \t\t\t- One of the ashes is only available if you give the potion to the Dung Eater or Nepheli, rather than letting Gideon dispose of it. (?)\r\n \r\n \r\n\t- A puppet of Sellen and Nepheli (if you give her the potion) can be found behind another illusory wall in the back of the cellar.\r\n\t- Upon receiving Dolores as a puppet it is discovered that Gideon and Seluvis were both in the Roundtable together, with Dolores. It is also noted that the two stopped talking because of her, implying a potential love triangle of sorts. \n    \t\t- The fact you receive Dolores only after giving Nepheli, Gideon's daughter, the potion and later find her as a doll also implies that Seluvis may have tired of Dolores as a puppet. It's possible he sought Gideon's daughter as a replacement or merely to get back at Gideon in some way\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"

    "mainContent": "**Blaidd** is an `NPC` in `Elden Ring`. **Blaidd** is a half man, half wolf, found howling in the `Mistwood Ruins`. He's the trusted friend and guardian of `Ranni the Witch`. Blaidd can be used as an `NPC Summon`.\r\n \r\n### Blaidd Location in Elden Ring\r\nBlaidd can be found initially at `Mistwood Ruins`, but must be found as part of his quest. \r\n- This NPC moves\r\n- This NPC can be fought\r\n- Can become hostile if the player kills ANY of the large rune bears before meeting him. (It's unclear why this makes him hostile, but several reports have shown him becoming hostile for no apparent reason, and the only link seems to be a rune bear being slain at ANY location prior to hearing his howling.)\r\n- Should Blaidd be hostile at first Encouter (maybe a Bug) you can visit the Church of Vows. After Atonement, Blaidd will reset. All Questlines involving Blaidd can be completed successfully.\r\n- `NPC Summon`: Speak to Blaidd first before the `Bloodhound Knight Darriwil` encounter to use him as a Summon\r\n \r\n### Blaidd Questline: How to complete Blaidd's Quest\r\n- Inside `Mistwood`, the player can occasionally hear a wolf howl. At this point, they can ask `Merchant Kale` about the howling. The merchant will teach the player the Finger Snap gesture.\r\n- Blaidd can be seen resting on the tallest point in the `Mistwood Ruins`, and will jump down after the player uses the gesture while standing below him. Blaidd will tell the player he is searching for a man who goes by the name \"Darriwil\".\r\n- `See it on the Elden Ring Map here`.\r\n\r\n- `Darriwil` can be fought at the `Forlorn Hound Evergaol`, where Blaidd will become available as a summon. Speak to Blaidd again after the fight. \n  \t- Talking to Blaidd once will yield a `Somber Smithing stone [2]`. Talk to him a second time and he will mention a `blacksmith` along the Road to the Manor in Liurnia, and instruct the player to say that \"Blaidd sent them\". Doing this will unlock the `Carian Filigreed Crest` in the blacksmith's shop.\r\n\t- If the Evergaol fight was completed before meeting Blaidd, he will still be available to speak to here after the player talks to him in the Mistwood Ruins.\r\n\t- See it on the `Elden Ring Map here`.\r\n \r\n\r\n- After meeting `Ranni the Witch` in Liurnia and taking on her quest, the player will need to meet Blaidd at `Siofra River`, which can be entered by taking the lift at the `Siofra River Well` in Mistwood. Blaidd will ask you to speak to `Preceptor Seluvis`, who in turn directs you to `Sorceress Sellen`. (`Map Link`) \n  \t- Blaidd will be located east of the Siofra River Bank site of grace, standing along the edge of a cliff nearby a Spirit Spring. You can find him on the Interactive Map `here`.\r\n \r\n- After speaking to Sellen, report back to Blaidd at Siofra River. He will request that you meet him at `Redmane Castle` to participate in a festival. `Map Link`\r\n- Blaidd can be found alongside other NPCs in the inner courtyard of Redmane Castle (where there is normally a boss fight when the festival event is not active). After speaking to the herald, `Jerren`, the festival will begin. Blaidd will be available as a summon during the fight in the desert against `Starscourge Radahn`. \n  \t- If the festival is triggered by using the `Grand Lift of Dectus` instead of through Ranni's questline, Blaidd will still show up at Redmane Castle. All prior interactions with Blaidd, as well as the initial portion of Ranni's questline, will be skipped. `Elden Ring Map Link`\r\n\t- If Blaidd is currently attending the festival and Radahn is not defeated, he will still be there even if you obtained and returned the Fingerslayer Blade to Ranni using glitches.\r\n \r\n- Once the festival is completed, the player can find Blaidd trapped inside the `Forlorn Hound Evergaol`. You can speak with Iji before or after this part of the questline for some additional dialogue. \n  \t- Optional. Blaidd still shows up at Ranni's Rise regardless of if the player did this part of the questline.\r\n\t- Players who wanted to interact with Blaidd should note that leaving Radahn's battlefield after his death is the trigger for Iji imprisoning Blaidd regardless of prior interaction or progress. He will remain in the evergoal until released or Ranni's quest is progressed to the end. \r\n\t- Additionally, if Radahn is killed before the first stages of Ranni's quest, Blaidd will be notably absent when you are otherwise tasked with speaking to her three servants, the other two being Iji and Seluvis, at the base of Ranni's Rise. \r\n \r\n- After completing Ranni's questline, return to Ranni's Rise where you may find Blaidd outside at the entrance, hostile. Defeating him will grant you his `greatsword` and his armor set (except the helm, which can be found near Seluvis's Rise). \n  \t- Note that you need FULL questline completion, which means after you get the `Dark Moon Greatsword` and not only up to when you give Ranni the Fingerslayer Blade.\r\n\t- Other factors effect whether Blaidd appears, which are not obvious will lead to him appearing. You can progress through Ranni's questline entirely without him appearing hostile, however he may appear later contigent on these unknown other factors.\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Blaidd Combat information\r\n- Health: \r\n- Poise: \r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Blaidd Drops\r\n `Runes`: **2000**\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Blaidd\r\nIntroduction at Mistwood Ruins\r\n- * Who goes there? Kalé send you, did he? Ever the bloody busybody. Hmm. Maybe to him, you don't seem so strange. The name's Blaidd. I'm looking for a man who goes by \"Darriwil.\" He fled somewhere nearby. Or so I've heard. Come tell me if you find him before I do. I can offer you ample reward. *\r\n- *Darriwil is nothing but a traitor. And in need of a fitting end to his tale. *\r\nAttacking him at Mistwood Ruins\r\n- *Oh? Fine. Time to douse your little flame.*\r\n- (On player kill)* Hmph. Pathetis little man.*\r\nWhen killed at Mistwood Ruins\r\n- *You're... you're strong of arm. But ask yourself... What harm can be done... to a shadow?*\r\nAs a summon in the Forlorn Hound Evergaol\r\n- *Darriwil... Rotting in a cell is no true justice. No, this is where it ends for you.*\r\nAfter defeating Darriwil\r\n- <sigh>* ...Right. There you are. Had to work for it, but it's done. Don't say I'm not a man of my word. Here's your prize.* <presents somber smithing stone>\r\n- *Oh yes, I should say - If you venture north to Raya Lucaria, and come across a venerable blacksmith who's a little on the large side... Tell him I sent you. And he'll be sure to treat you right. I owe you one, I reckon.*\r\n- *That's enough chit-chat for now. It's time we parted ways.*\r\nIn spectral form, after meeting Ranni at Ranni’s Rise\r\n- *Ahh, long time, friend. Blaidd, if you’ve forgotten. Glad to have you in the service of mistress Ranni. *\r\n- *Well. Getting right to business... I’m still in Limgrave. The eternal city of Nokron lies somewhere at the bottom of this land. I’m planning to go below through the well in the Mistwood. See if I can’t find the road to Nokron from there...*\r\nUpon meeting him at Siofra River\r\n- *Ah, good to see you. Apologies mate, but I don’t have much to report. I can see bloody Nokron, right above me, but I’m absolutely stumped. I’ve tried all the gateways, to no avail... Perhaps it’s time to ask Seluvis? I recall that spiteful little rat acting like he knew something... Let’s give him a squeeze. Show him just how sharp my teeth are...*\r\n- *I jest, I wouldn’t go that far. Besides, I should check on some things here. Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right. If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right? And if we reach a dead end, I suppose we go back to the source. Seluvis rarely gives a straight answer, the first time.*\r\nSecond meeting at Siofra River, after talking to Sorceress Sellen\r\n- *Ah. Well met. What news?*\r\nAfter selecting “Tell Sellen’s story” dialogue option.\r\n- *Hmm... So Ranni’s fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn... That reminds me of something I heard. There’s a festival being held at the castle on the southern edge of the Caelid Wilds, east of Limgrave. It’s a festival of combat. And I heard... that you can fight Radahn himself. He who was once called the strongest of all the demigods... Maybe it’s just a coincidence, but I think it’s worth investigating. I’ll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then...*\r\n- *You’re coming too, right? To Radahn’s festivities... I’ll meet you at Redmane Castle in Caelid. The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang.*\r\nAfter selecting “Don’t say anything” dialogue option.\r\n- ???\r\nAt Redmane Castle before the festival of Radahn begins\r\n- *Ah, there you are. Took your sweet time. The players are all made up, and waiting for the curtain... Let’s give them a show to remember, eh. Just don’t you go dying on me. For Ranni’s sake, too.*\r\nAfter defeating Radahn\r\n- *Ah, good. I was waiting for you. What a sick way to fight, eh. The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you. And hah! Did you see that, afterwards? A falling star, right before our eyes! I can’t fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale. He was a living legend, if ever I saw one. And, the path has now been cleared. To Nokron, where Ranni’s fate will be decided. Let’s meet where the falling star bit the earth. We’ll take up our swords once more. For mistress Ranni. *\r\n- *Let’s meet where the falling star bit the earth. And we’ll go into battle again, side by side. My only purpose is to fight for Ranni’s fate, sword and fang. The curtain’s rising... on the final act.*\r\nBlaidd’s message left at Mistwood Ruins (before the player enters Nokron)\r\n- *There’s a traitor taken care of. Onwards to Nokron, then. Go on, I’ll catch up.*\r\nAt Forlorn Hound Evergaol after defeating Radahn\r\n- *Oh, it's you... It's me, Blaidd. Old Iji trapped me here. Told me I'd bring nought but bale to Lady Ranni. But there's no chance that could happen. I'm part of her being. Her very shadow... I thought old Iji knew as much... Honestly, I don't know what's going on anymore...*\r\n- [Open the evergaol]* My thanks, friend. I'm going to see mistress Ranni, now. I don't know what came over old Iji, but even if the odds are slim, I need to check the mistress is safe. Now, Ranni can finally set in motion the fight against her fate she's dreamt of for so long.*\r\nBefore fighting a hostile Blaidd, outside the tower of Ranni’s Rise\r\n- <muttering to himself> *No. I’m part of her very being! I could never betray her! No matter what might happen... Ranni... She needs me...*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Blaidd Notes & Trivia\r\n- 'Blaidd' is Welsh for wolf.\r\n- Is referred to, by War Counselor Iji, as becoming more like a brother to Lady Ranni.\r\n \r\n \r\n"

Speaking with Gowry is required to complete Millicent's questline.\r\n \r\n### Gowry's Location in Elden Ring\r\nGowry can be found at `Gowry's Shack` located in eastern `Caelid`, just before reaching `Sellia, Town of Sorcery`.

Ask him why he's crying and he will ask you to kill Millicent, rather than help her in battle, as he wishes for her to become a flower.\r\n1. **Assist Millicent:** Upon returning to his shack, Gowry will be lamenting over Millicent's decision to remove the needle. Killing him at this point will not cause him to respawn, and he will drop `Flock's Canvas Talisman` and `Gowry's Bell Bearing`.\r\n1. **Challenge Millicent: **Upon returning to his shack, Gowry will be dead and you can also retrieve the Flock's Canvas Talisman and Gowry's Bell Bearing.\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Gowry Shop\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Gowry\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Oh, a pleasure to see you. a pleasure indeed. **I am Gowry. A great sage, in my day anyway. I'd hoped to ask favour, when one of your ilk came along. A strapping young Tarnished, able to cross the Scarlet swamp of Aeonia.  Don't fret, I'll provide fine recompense. Should you accept.. I will teach you the secret of Sellia, the town you see there. *\r\n- *Ah, then you're willing to lend a hand, are you? I need your help to heal a certain young girl. Her name is Millicent. You will find her beyond Sellia resting at the church atop. the cliff stricken by the rotting sickness. *\r\n- *First you must find the unalloyed gold needle. It's hidden somewhere deep in the scarlet swamp of Aeonia.  Then I will tell you as promised. The secret of the town of Sellia. *\r\nVisit\r\n- *Ohh, you've found the unalloyed gold needle. As promised I've detailed the secret of Sellia right here. Go on, its yours. Now, let me have a look at the needle. *\r\n- *The needle is repaired. Now it will forestall the rotting sickness I'm sure. Will you give it to the girl, Millicent? I will reward you in kind. Millicent rests at the church atop the cliff, beyond Sellia, the town yonder. Tended to by the witless pests who worship her, or rather, her rotting sickness, as a god. A wretched fate indeed. The poor girl, she never wished for any of this. *\r\n- *Do you find it peculiar? That I would show such concern for the girl? Well, I'm the one who found her. A mere babe, in the swamp of Aeonia. She is one of my dear daughters. But the rotting sickness erodes one's memory. I doubt that she remembers the first thing about me. Oh, I must be getting old. I didn't always worry so much. *\r\nAfter Millicent has visited and left Gowry's Shack\r\n- *Oh, you noticed, did you?Indeed, Millicent did visit this hovel of a home.It seems the memories eaten away by the rotting sickness yet remain, but faintly.However, she has no need of me, any more.No, she must embark on her journey, and stare her fate in the eye. I mustn't impede.As I've aged, I've found the best way to aid the young...Is to be forgotten.*\r\n- *Please make certain that little Millicent goes unharmed.Like her mother, she has the stuff to be a great warrior,but commands only one arm, and is yet preciously young.*\r\nAfter giving Millicent the Valkyrie Prosthesis\r\n- *This is a wonderful development. Thank you for your kindness. Now Millicent may fully realise her true warrior's potential. Like her beautiful mother.*\r\n- *Green and undeveloped, waiting to flower into magnificence. What a wondrous day that will be. In truth, before her, I'd never seen a bud of such superior quality. She might very well outshine her sisters.*\r\nAfter giving Millicent the Valkyrie Prosthesis and purchasing the Pest Threads incantation\r\n- *Do you have an interest in rot incantations? Then you might like to learn something of the history...of Malenia, goddess of scarlet rot.*\r\n- *\"Queen Marika and her King Consort Radagon were blessed with twin demigods, and Malenia was one of them.She was born an Empyrean, carrying the scarlet rot.An Empyrean...is no mere demigod.In the age of the Elden Ring, and Queen Marika, the precious Empyrean was born. A new god to forge a new Order.Since Malenia fought Radahn, and the great scarlet flower blossomed in Aeonia, I have dedicated myself to her.And to the resplendence of the Order of Rot. The cycle of decay and rebirth.\"*\r\nAfter speaking to Millicent at the Prayer Room Site of Grace\r\n- *The words of a true innocent, the dear girl. Well, perhaps this is just as it should be. Little Millicent, following in the steps of her mother, no matter what. This is their fate, after all.*\r\nOnce you have the choice to help or invade Millicent:\r\n- [Why are you crying?] *\"Oh it's just...**I realised that I'd soon be saying my goodbyes to Millicent, and...**My eyes began to well...**She is to meet them very soon. Her sisters.**And when she does, she'll be defeated, surely, and begin to flower.\"*\r\n- [Become a flower? (1)] *\"Which is why...**If you happen to be present for the girl's fight with her sisters,**I ask that you side with the sisters and kill Millicent.**It must be done by your hand; no other.**Millicent trusts you, rather deeply in fact.**Sever that trust. Nurtured by betrayal, her bud will flower most vividly.**When Malenia ascends to godhood, Millicent too shall be reborn.**As a scarlet valkyrie.\"*\r\n- [Become a flower? (2)] *\"You can't tell me you don't wish to see it.**The superior bud that is Millicent, becoming the finest of flowers?**I beg of you, kill her. With your own two hands.\"*\r\nOther\r\n- *\"We shall meet again, you and I. There are countless pests to choose from.\" (First time killing Gowry)*\r\n- *\"We shall meet again. As many times as it takes. For you to understand.\" (Subsequent killing at Gowry's Shack after the first)*\r\n- *\"Have you taken the lesson, now? Killing me is an exercise in futility. All is well, provided you understand. Let's just pretend it never happened, shall we?\" (Dialogue after talking to him at Gowry's Shack after he has respawned)*\r\nAfter assisting Millicent and her quest ends\r\n- *Millicent, my daughter. Why would you take out the needle? You were so close. So very close. To becoming the fairest of all flowers. Would you disown us too? As your Mother did? We children of the scarlet rot?*\r\n- *Millicent... Malenia... Do you detest us, so utterly?*\r\nAfter killing Millicent at the Church of Plague\r\n- *\"O Millicent, my daughter... Who would prune your sapling flesh?Such...such cruel and vulgar violence...\"*\r\n- *\"O Millicent... My most promising little bud...\"*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Gowry Notes & Trivia\r\n- Killing him at Gowry's Shack reveals the body to be a `Kindred of Rot` followed by dialogue from Gowry suggesting his actual body is elsewhere. When reloading the world he will have respawned.\r\n- If you choose to assist Millicent rather than invade her, you may be locked out of getting the `Flock's Canvas Talisman`. Sometimes, Gowry cannot be killed and will continue to turn into the kindred of rot. It is not known if this is intentional or a bug.\r\n \r\n \r\n"

The quest can be completed after reaching the Haligtree Roots grace, and can still be completed after defeating Malenia. (Tested March 28 2022 on Patch 1.03.2) The quest can be done quickly if the player defeats the bosses or otherwise obtains the quest items before exhausting dialogue. (Tested on Unalloyed Gold Needle, Valkyrie's Prothesis, and Godskin Apostle)\r\nQuestline Objectives:\r\n- Speak with `Gowry` in his `shack` and he will ask for a favor. He wants help to heal a young girl, `Millicent`, found beyond Sellia, who has the Scarlet Rot. To do this he will ask you to seek an `Unalloyed Gold Needle` dropped by `Commander O'Neil` located in the deep scarlet `Swamp of Aeonia`, outside Sellia's bounds. In return, he will share the secrets of the town of Sellia. \r\n- You will need to take the `Unalloyed Gold Needle` by defeating Commander O'Neil and give it to Gowry. After returning to him, he'll tell you he'll need some time to repair the needle and will give you `Sellia's Secret`.\r\n- Warp to a nearby point or quit game then reload and return and he'll give you the repaired needle.\r\n- Bring the needle to Millicent at the `Church of the Plague`.\t- OPTIONAL, Not required to progress Millicent's questline.Light the beacons in Sellia, according to the secret `Gowry` gave you, in order to open the way to the church. Three need to be lit and this will also unlock treasure chests behind each barrier with the final barrier allowing access to a double boss fight.\r\n \r\n- After Millicent uses the needle, rest at the nearby site of grace, then exhaust her dialogue. She will gift you the `Prosthesis-Wearer Heirloom`. Upon reloading the area, she will have moved to Gowry's shack.\r\n- Return to Gowry's shack to find him gone, but Millicent is there. Exhaust her dialogue. Reload the area, and Millicent will move, and Gowry will return. You can now purchase spells from him. \n  \t- Millicent can be summoned to fight `Magma Wyrm Makar` in the `Ruin-Strewn Precipice` after this point.\r\n \r\n- Millicent will now be located just North East of the Erdtree-Gazing Hill Grace standing near the edge of the cliff on the Altus Plateau. [`Map Link`]. \n  \t- After exhausting Millicent's dialogue, the player will need to go North to `The Shaded Castle` and retrieve the `Valkyrie's Prosthesis`, which is found in a chest in the room guarded by a single `Cleanrot Knight` on the North-Western edge of The Shaded Castle. Return to her and give her the Valkyrie's Prosthesis item to advance her quest line after exhausting her dialogue. You can obtain the Valkyrie's Prosthesis before even starting the entire questline and will not effect anything.\r\n \r\n- Go to `Dominula, Windmill Village`, and defeat the `Godskin Apostle`. Millicent's summon sign is at the base of the hill north west of the `Stake of Marika`.\r\n- After defeating the boss of the area, she will be near the Windmill Heights Grace after reload [`Map Link`]. Exhaust her dialogue to continue the quest.\r\n- Millicent can be summoned to fight the `Black Blade Kindred` boss in `Forbidden Lands`.\r\n- Millicent will move to the Ancient Snow Valley Ruins Grace at `Mountaintops of the Giants`. Exhaust her dialogue to continue. [`Elden Ring Map Link`]\r\n- Millicent will next be available at the Prayer Room Grace at `Elphael Brace of the Haligtree`. She will not move from this spot until the player has defeated the nearby `Ulcerated Tree Spirit` mini-boss. To reach the mini-boss, go to the Drainage Channel Site of Grace. Go west through the door and go up the ladder and through the door at the top. The mini-boss is at the landmass across the gap to the left. To reach it, go to the top of the slope to the right and walk across the tree branch to the southwest to cross the gap. [`Elden Ring Map Link`]\r\n- Once the player has defeated the mini-boss, there will be two summon signs near where the mini-boss used to be. Specifically, on the northwest hill around the lake The player can either: \n  \t- Be summoned into her world and help fight 4 NPC invaders called `Millicent's Sisters`, granting you the `Rotten Winged Sword Insignia` upon completion. \n    \t\t- Mary, Eldest Sister.

Wields a Blade of Calling.\r\n \r\n\t- Be summoned as an invader in order to challenge her, granting you `Millicent's Prosthesis` upon completion, but not the `Unalloyed Gold Needle`.\r\n \r\n- If the player chose to help Millicent, the player can find her near where her summoning sign was, laying by the pool of scarlet rot down below. Exhaust all of her dialogue, then reload the area. Interact with her once more, and she will give you the `Unalloyed Gold Needle`, ending her questline.\t- The `Unalloyed Gold Needle` can be used at the flower in `Malenia`'s arena in order to receive `Miquella’s Needle`, as well as a `Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone`.\r\n \r\n- Returning to Sage `Gowry` you will find flavour text regarding Malenia and Millicent's connection. You will no longer be able to purchase from the Sage. \n  \t- If you kill Sage Gowry at this point, you will receive the `Flock's Canvas Talisman` and `Gowry's Bell Bearing`, if he is already dead both items will still be obtainable from his corpse found in `Gowry's Shack`.\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Millicent\r\nUpon entering the `Church of the Plague`, `Caelid`\r\n- Ah...Ahh\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Nggh... Who's there? Well, it matters not. If you are wise, you will leave, immediately. My flesh writhes with scarlet rot. It is a curse. Not to be meddled with by man.*\r\nUpon giving her the `Unalloyed Gold Needle`\r\n- *You ask that I stab myself with the needle... To quell the scarlet rot? But...how? ... Never mind. I've decided. I would rather trust you, than simply continue to spoil from within. Would you mind...averting your eyes for a moment? Well. That was easier than expected. But...why do I feel so...*\r\nUpon reloading area\r\n- *I...hoped to see you again. My apologies for when last we met. I fainted before I could even thank you. Everything is as you said. Since inserting the needle, the scarlet rot has ceased to writhe. Even the nightmares have abated... And now, thought I can scarcely believe it myself, I can move as I please. It is all thanks to you. Not that I could every truly repay you, but I would like you to have this, by way of thanks. A token, though it is. *\r\nAttacking her after giving her the Unalloyed Gold Needle\r\n- (Warning)* Ugh. Is there something wrong? Please, cease this at once.*\r\n- (Combat)* Why are you doing this? Now you've forced my hand.*\r\n- (On player kill)* I will not forget what you did for me. But this day marks our farewell.*\r\nAfter receiving the `Prosthesis-Wearer Heirloom`\r\n- *I'm considering leaving. On a journey. With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly... My destiny... My name is Millicent. I pray fate permits us meet again.*\r\nAt Gowry's Shack\r\n- *Oh, hello again. Something about this place felt familiar to me. So I decided to pay a visit, hoping to find someone here. But I've only found emptiness. Perhaps before my departure, I needed someone to say farewell to. I must focus on my journey, for which I have you to thank.*\r\n- *I must stay strong. I must focus on my journey, for which I have you to thank.*\r\nNorth of the Erdtree-Gazing Hill Grace on the Altus Plateau\r\n- *Ah. We meet again. In truth, it's been smooth sailing, for me. The scarlet rot has stilled, since last we met. As such, I've been able to continue my journey. I realise that if I still had my sword arm, I could have aided you in battle.*\r\n- *Now, I'm tracing the path Malenia took, after unleashing the power of the scarlet rot, during her battle with General Radahn, in the Caelid Wilds. I should like to meet her, this vanished woman. I think she's in the north. In the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree.*\r\nAfter giving her the Valkyrie's Prosthesis\r\n- *Giving me this arm? I thank you. I am in your debt, yet again. I think, if the arm serves well enough, it might be possible for me to wield a sword again.*\r\n- *If the arm serves well enough, it might be possible for me to wield a sword again. Perhaps, then. I can aid you in battle.*\r\nNear the Windmill Heights Grace on the Altus Plateau \r\n- *Ah, we meet yet again. The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder. It feels just like my own, even handling a sword. Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword. Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need. **It is the only way that I can express my thanks.*\r\nNear the Ancient Snow Valley Ruins Grace at Mountaintops of the Giants\r\n- *To think we'd meet in such a place... What could your purpose possibly... **No, I know well enough who you are, and what I know is good enough for me. Call upon me again in battle, should you have the need.*\r\n- *I'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins. I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree. Indeed, I believe that is where Malenia will be found. The Haligtree is hidden somewhere in these Northern lands.*\r\nNear the Prayer Room Grace at Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree\r\n- *Again we meet. **I can only surmise our purposes are aligned. In which case, allow me to explain myself. I am of Malenia's blood. But in what capacity I know not. I could be sister, daughter, or an offshoot... Whatever the case though, I am certain of a kinship between us.*\r\n- *There is something I must return to Malenia. The will that was once her own. The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot. The pride she abandoned, to meet Radahn's measure.*\r\nAfter choosing to help Millicent at the end of her questline, laying by the pool near where her summoning sign was\r\n- *Thank you for lending your hand. Without your help, I could not have defeated that quartet. I feel as if I've been in your debt from beginning to end.  **Thank you. With your help, I was able to live as my own person, if only in passing. *\r\n- *But this is where things end. I pause to even tell you, but... I took out the needle myself. **Tell whoever put you up to this. That if I am to flower into something other than myself, I would rather rot into nothingness as I am.*\r\n- *Please, let me pass alone. The scarlet rot writhes now, worse than ever. Soon, I won't be more than a mound of flesh. Curse-laden. Untouchable. I wouldn't want such a thing to bring you harm.*\r\nKilling Millicent at the end of her questline in `Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree` before reloading the area\r\n- *I did not expect it to end like this. But I will not forget what you have done.*\r\nAfter choosing to challenge Millicent\r\n- *Ahh, how could you... Is this your true heart? Was I... was it all...for this?*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Millicent Notes & Trivia\r\n- In combat, Millicent wields a unique version of the `Shamshir` that has the `Waterfowl Dance` Skill, which is normally only found on the `Hand of Malenia`. Before she receives the prosthesis, she uses it in her left hand, never two-handing it or doing anything else that would involve her right arm, and she won't use its Skill either.\r\n- When fighting her as NPC invader in the swamp it is recommended to have `Flame, Cleanse Me` to cleanse the `Scarlet Rot`. Millicent is also susceptible to Scarlet Rot buildup.\r\n- The name \"Millicent\" comes from the old Germanic name *Amalasuintha, *composed of the words \"Amal\" which means \"work,labor\" and \"Swinth\", which means \"strong\". Alternatively, the French variation, *Mélisande, *means \"brave strength\". This fits directly back into Millicent's character, who despite being heavily afflicted with the Scarlet Rot and lacking an arm, is able to travel from Caelid all the way to the Haligtree all on her own---requiring only some assistance from the Player.\r\n \r\n \r\n"

This makes it impossible to begin and complete her quest. A handful of players confirmed that she was dead after obtaining both halves of the Haligtree Secret Medallion. To prevent this, just make sure to grab her Ashes before progressing past the `Grand Lift of Rold`, to prevent disruption.\r\nPromising Latenna to take her to the Haligtree, she will join the player and willingly become a `Spirit Ash` summon, `Latenna the Albinauric`. She will also hint at the location of the `Haligtree Secret Medallion (Left)`.Upon reaching the `Apostate Derelict` (`map link`) located in the Consecrated Snowfield players can interact with the giant Albinauric woman to summon Latenna. Do`Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone`\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Latenna\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Foul tarnished, what do you want?I told the all-hearing brute. That I possess no such medallion.Or have you come to take more from me? Was my other half not enough?*\r\nAfter showing her the secret medallion\r\n- *Oh...do you speak true?So old Albus entrusted his medallion to you.... Then I've no choice. But to trust that this was his dying will.Let's try again. I'm Latenna. An Albinauric, the same as Old Albus. My apologies for my coarse words earlier. I presumed the worst, seeing that you were another Tarnished, like that all-hearing brute. I hope that you will forgive me.*\r\n- *Mm, the medallion is better off in your hands, anyway.Would you consider doing me a great service? I must go back. There is something that I must do, even if I must say farewell to my wolf, Lobo. Will you show me the way? To the land of Miquella's Haligtree.If you accept, I would gladly apprise you. Of the whereabouts of the medallion's other half.*\r\n- (Hear her request) *Thank you kindly. They say the other half of the medallion is beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree. In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold. *\r\n- *Then I suppose it's time. Farewell, Lobo. My faithful wolf, my better half. I will go with the Tarnished. So that our journey will not have been in vain. Forgive me, Lobo.**Call upon me when needed. And I will fight at your side.*\r\nApproaching Castle Sol\r\n- *Do you hear me? It is I, Latenna. We're almost there. Castle Sol lies just off to the north, where the other medallion is housed. It will grant passage to the land of the Haligtree.*\r\nArriving at Consecrated Snowfield\r\n- *Do you hear me? It is I, Latenna. We have reached the land of Miquella's Haligtree, where Lobo and I began our travels. It's entirely thanks to you that I'm so close to home. These great snow-laden lands stretch far to the north. And beyond the ancient bowers, and the liturgical town of Ordina, lies the place to which I must return.*\r\nAt Apostate Derelict\r\n- *Oh young yet towering sister of ours. Let the birthing droplet in. And create life. For us. For all the Albinaurics.*\r\n- *Thank you. I've finally fulfilled my purpose.Our young yet towering sister will give us hope. Now that nothing is left unfinished, I will join you in battle to the bitter end. And when the fighting is done, then you may lay me to rest. Beside Lobo, my dear wolf.*\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- (Combat)* Are all you Tarnished the same? Was taking my other half not enough for you?*\r\n- (On player kill) *There is no meaning in a fight, lest it serve a greater duty.*\r\nUpon defeat\r\n- *Ohh... Phillia. Take...the birthing...droplet...*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Latenna Notes & Trivia\r\n- Latenna makes mention that her better half Lobo, the wolf beside her, was taken from her by the “all-hearing brute,” likely talking about `Ensha`, who invades after obtaining the medallion’s half in the Roundtable.\r\n- Her spirit summon makes mention that 'having lost her beloved wolf companion, she cannot move from the place where she was summoned'. This explains that she rode the wolf around, and why she cannot move from her location. \r\n- The name of her wolf companion was \"Lobo\", which means \"wolf\" in Spanish.\r\n- If Latenna is summoned near `Direwolves`, she will tame and ride one, making her significantly mobile, firing arrows along with breathing frosted breath. \r\n \r\n"

He claims that `Yura` died and gave him this body.\r\n- Shabriri gives you directions for obtaining the Lord of the Frenzied Flame ending. You must meet with the `Three Fingers` by finding them near the `Cathedral of the Forsaken` below the `Subterranean Shunning-Grounds`. You must remove your clothes in order to open the door and proceed. See `Endings` for more information. \n  \t- **Note:**\r\n\t- \r\n \r\n- After you meet with the Three Fingers, Shabriri will disappear, and the `Ronin's Set` will be left in his place. You can also kill Shabriri for the set as soon as you meet him.\r\n \r\n### Shabriri Notes and Tips\r\n- If player meets with the Three Fingers before reaching where Shabriri is, he will not be found. The Ronin's Set will be on the floor in his place.\r\n- He wields Yura’s `Nagakiba` and uses Frenzied Flame Incantations.\r\n \r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Shabriri\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *Finally, we meet. The Tarnished who would be Lord. Oh my, why the long face?*\r\n- *I fear that you were previously acquainted with this vessel. Well, that is most unfortunate. For he is dead. As for his flesh, he gave it to me, Shabriri. I hope you can make your peace with that. *\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- *What's this? Well, this is peculiar. This, I did not expect. But if you do not care for Lordship, I'm afraid you are of no use.*\r\n- (On player kill)* How very unfortunate. I did not take you for a fraud.*\r\nWhen killed\r\n- *Shabriri is chaos incarnate. I cannot die. Ahh, may chaos take the world!*\r\nVisit\r\n- *You are about to sacrifice something precious. The life of a fair maiden, that you would toss into the fiery forge. Only so that you may be Lord. What a horrible thing to ponder. Your ascendency requires her sacrifice, whether she wishes it or not. But how would the Lord, crowned so, be looked upon?*\r\n- *Chosen Tarnished and would-be Lord, dare to tread the path of true rigor. Spare the poor girl, and singe your own flesh in her stead. If you are prepared to show resolve and attain Lordship through righteous hardship, then heed the words of I, Shabriri.*\r\n- *Chosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord. Descend into the depths, far below the Erdtree Capital. Seek audience with the Three Fingers and the flame of frenzy. If you inherit the flame of frenzy, your flesh will serve as kindling and the girl can be spared ...setting you on the righteous path of lordship. The path of the Lord of Chaos. Burn the Erdtree to the ground, and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes. Ahhh, may chaos take the world! May chaos take the world! *\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Shabriri Notes & Trivia\r\n- Can be summoned as a cooperator for the `Godfrey, First Elden Lord` boss fight.\r\n- Shabriri is the name of a Demon of Blindness in Jewish mythology, which is hinted at here due to the hands suggestively covering his eyes. In modern Hebrew, Shabriri translates literally as \"fragile\".\r\n- He is referenced in the talisman `Shabriri's Woe`, as a man who had his eyes gouged out, and had the frenzied flame inhabit his sockets, which may explain why he covers his face. \r\n- He may also be in relation to `Hyetta`, as they both inherit the bodies of former characters, and are related to the Frenzied Flame.\r\n \r\n \r\n"

How did you slip inside, with the gate closed? Hmph. No matter. If you can fell one of them, you're a champion, in my book. I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness. Incidentally, do you like a good festival, from time to time? Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished. But when the stars align, we celebrate. A war festival honoring the last battle and death of General Radahn, the mightiest demigod of the Shattering, and bearer of a Great Rune.*\r\n- [I'm not the festive type] *Well, you're not much fun, are you, chum? No matter. One day you will see. That true warriors bask in glory at the festival. *\r\n- [About Iji] *Well, I haven't heard that name in an age. Then you must serve Princess Ranni? The next time you speak to Iji, tell him this: The festival of Radahn will surely set Ranni's fate into motion. By the by... Is that old fool still hammering out weapons? His enormous frame, cramped in that little place... Bit of a haughty sort. Strange fella, when I knew him. And funny thing, his swords were all blunt as stone. But not one of them decayed when faced with the scarlet rot...*\r\n- *Go on, now. This old geezer hasn't any use for you just yet.*\r\nAfter the festival\r\n- *At last, the war festival has ended. Brave champion you have our gratitude. The Celebration was spectacular. General Radahn is surely pleased. Festering with rot, and crippled by madness, all he wanted was an honorable death. *\r\n- *Finally, my work is done. I am no longer bound to this fortress. I have a task in mind. Old business you could say. You wouldn't understand. May we meet again if the fates deign it, brave champion. *\r\nFestival Proclamation\r\n- * Champions, welcome! The stars have aligned! The festival is nigh! General Radahn, mightiest demigod of the Shattering, awaits you! *\r\n- *Are you good and prepared, young chum? The festival begins!*\r\nSmall Talk (Witchbane Ruins)\r\n- *Ah, well met. I hardly expected to see the champion of the festival here of all places. You didn't ... know Sellen did you? Well, whatever the case, she's dead now. Just put it behind you. She was known as the graven witch Obsessed by the primeval current, countless sorcerers fell to her hands. The most dangerous mage in the entire history of Raya Lucaria's Academy*\r\n- *It is strange through. The woman, she was like a husk, her soul already fled. I suspect Sellen lives on, elsewhere. I'm sure she'll turn up eventually, in another body. A sickening thought, but one that won't stop gnawing at me. *\r\nSiding with Jerren, during `Sorceress Sellen` invasion\r\n- *\"Sellen, Graven Witch, enemy of Caria.**I vow this time to crush both your fame and your primal glintstone.**I am Jerren, bringer of your death. Do not forget.\"*\r\nFinal\r\n- *My thanks, for the aid given. I heard from Iji that Lady Ranni might have found herself a champion. But I  didn't know he was talking about you. You've helped me fulfil an old promise. This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it. *\r\n- *Well, I must be leaving now. Brave warrior, if the fates deign it.. No, we shall indeed meet again, at the next glorious tourney.*\r\n- *Well, I must be leaving now. If the fates deign it, may we meet again, Tarnished.*\r\n*When attacked*\r\n- *Ugh! What's the matter with you? You trying to get revenge?*\r\n- (Combat)* Very well. If the Graven Witch put you under her spell, you must be eliminated...*\r\n- (On player kill)* Rest now. Alongside the witch's corpse.*\r\n- (On death)* You...are a menace... Iji...beware...*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Witch-Hunter Jerren Notes & Trivia\r\n- Can be summoned during the second phase of Radahn's boss fight\r\n- In combat, Jerren wields a `Flamberge` with the `Flaming Strike` Ash of War, and a `Carian Glintblade Staff`, which he uses to cast `Magic Glintblade`.\r\n \r\n \r\n"

Initially encountered as the thief of `Rya`'s `Necklace`, he is a minor NPC and merchant. \r\nHe is involved in the questlines of `Rya` and the `Dung Eater`. Blackguard Big Boggart is available as an `NPC Summon` against `Magma Wyrm Makar` by progressing his questline.\r\n \r\n### Blackguard Location in Elden Ring\r\nBlackguard Big Boggart can be initially found in the `Liurnia of the Lakes` swamps at the `Boilprawn Shack`, just north of the Scenic Isle grace. [`Elden Ring Map Link`]\r\nOnce befriended, he can be summoned for the `Magma Wyrm Makar` fight at the `Ruin-Strewn Precipice`.\r\nHe then later moves to `Leyndell` in the nothern-most section of the outer moat near the Capital Rampart. [`Elden Ring Map Link`]\r\n \r\n- This merchant can be fought.\r\n- If defeated, drops: `Blackguard's Iron Mask`, `Iron Ball`, `Blackguard's Bell Bearing`, 1000 runes\r\n \r\n### Blackguard's Shop\r\n \r\n \r\n### Blackguard Big Boggart Questline: How to complete Blackguard Big Boggart's Quest\r\n- Boggart is introduced as the thief who stole a `necklace` from `Rya`. He is unremorseful but offers to sell the necklace back. He warns the player that Rya isn't right in the head.\r\n- The player can choose to buy the necklace back from him for 1000 runes, or just kill him. You must at least initiate the quest from Rya before reaching `Volcano Manor`, when she moves there. If you don't, you will be unable to progress Boggart's questline.\r\n- If they bought the necklace back, the player can buy `Boiled Prawns` from him, after which he remarks that he's never met someone with a taste for prawns he couldn't trust. This befriends him and progresses his questline.\r\n- He can then be summoned for the `Magma Wyrm Makar` fight.\r\n- If the player bought prawns from him, he later moves to Leyndell in the outer moat nearest the Capital Rampart. He will be boiling and selling `Boiled Crabs`.\r\n- At the Leyndell moat, he will warn the player about his time in prison with the Dung Eater, where he saw him do \"unspeakable acts\" to corpses. Boggart warns the player to stay clear of him.\r\n- If the `Dung Eater`'s questline is at the point where he will be \"waiting in the outer moat\", and the blackguard is present in Leyndell, exhaust Big Boggart's dialogue here until he says he thinks the Dung Eater is lurking somewhere nearby.\r\n- Then reload the area, and you must interact with the now-wounded blackguard to trigger the invasion.\r\n- A `Seedbed Curse` will be found on Big Boggart's body at the end of his questline, along with his drops. If you have been invaded by the Dung Eater in the moat before Boggart moves there, you will be unable to get a Seedbed Curse from his body.\r\n### Dialogue in Elden Ring: Blackguard\r\nIntroduction\r\n- *What are you lookin' at? You trying to start something, mate?*\r\nVisit\r\n- *Oh piss off, what is it now? **Oh, I see. You want some of me prawn? Freshly cooked it is. Alright then. It's yours, if you can meet me price. I could be persuaded to sell you some other bits too, if you've got the runes.*\r\n- *Marika's tits, you must be 'ungry.*\r\n- *Alright, mate. Want some more prawn, do ya?*\r\nVisit in Leyndell\r\n- *What are you lookin' at? Oh... you again, is it. Perfect bloody timing, actually. I got crab, cooked up fresh.*\r\n- *Alright, mate. Want some more crab, do ya?*\r\nDialogue Choices\r\n- **(Give me the necklace*****)** Oh, that necklace what you're after, is it? Hmm, well... Show me what it's worth to you, and I'll consider parting ways with it. I'm not in love with it or nothing.*\r\n- **(Leave, then talk)** *What the hell is wrong with you. You trying to start something? Piss off. Before I crack you in 'alf.*\r\n- **(Deal)*** You're a shrewd one, chief. First, you hand me the runes. And don't try nothin', neither.*\r\n- **(Refuse)** *Think you're bloody clever, do ya? Then how about you piss off? fore I crack you in 'alf.*\r\n- **(Refuse, then talk)** *This bloody swine... Decided to play ball now, 'ave you? You'll be wanting the necklace, then?*\r\nSmall Talk\r\n- **(About Rya)*** Oh, so you met the girl, did ya? Alright, well, sod the particulars of the matter, but it ain't my fault she's stupid enough to get duped, is it. Anyway, she ain't all right, that one. Lucky she ain't died on the bloody roadside, I reckon.*\r\n- *You're Tarnished too, ain'tcha? Can you see it then? The guidance of grace, I mean. I can't see it at all no more. Makes no bloody sense anyway, why some no-name shithead like me should get called to the Lands Between. Cruel bloody joke, you ask me. Maybe something went tits up with it. Maybe... it's been broke for a good long time. The Erdtree, I'm sayin'. *\r\nSmall Talk in Leyndell\r\n- *You 'eard of the Dung Eater? E's a madman, 'as it out for everyone. Curses 'em. Goes 'round in this rank armour, an' all. You see 'im though, stay well away. I was in the same gaol as him, once, so I know first 'and. E's a god-forsaken monster. Not just some petty thug like me. *\r\n- **(About the Dung Eater)*** E's a killer. Kills people and curses their souls... Does all sorts of **** to their corpses, to keep 'em cursed, forever. I ain't seen nothin' more disgustin' in all my years. I ain't never been more scared, neither. Rooted to the bloody spot... While 'e did all that, to my friend...*\r\n- **(About the Dung Eater, after releasing him) ***Never thought I would. What 'e does to those bodies. It was... It was 'im, no question. That monster. He's lurkin' round 'ere.*\r\nWounded\r\n- *Heh... serves me right. Fitting bloody end, for a jumped up little **** with big ideas...*\r\n- *Help me out, would ya, mate... I don't wanna get cursed. Just let me die... I don't wanna live like this... not anymore... So, please...*\r\nCombat\r\n- (Warning)* What's your blinkin' problem! You don't mess with Big Boggart, mate.*\r\n- (Combat)* That ***** put you up to this, eh. Damn it! I'll rip you to shreds!*\r\n- (On player kill) *You feel that, eh? That's the fists of Big Boggart.*\r\n- (On death) *Goddamn it. Why ain't it me, why ain't it ever...*\r\nOther\r\n- (After buying prawns)* Never met someone with a taste for prawns I couldn't trust. We'd make good mates, I reckon. I'll be seeing ya.*\r\n- (After buying Rya's Necklace)* Hmm... Alright. Take it. Thing's no damn use to anyone, anyway. Your bloody idea, mate. Don't come crying to me later.*\r\n### Blackguard Big Boggart Notes & Trivia\r\n- Although he is primarily referred to as just 'Blackguard', he refers to his own name while in combat when saying, *\"You don't mess with Big Boggart, mate\"*.  Additionally, his mask states \"Worn by the blackguard Big Boggart\". His weapon is also described as \"Big Boggart the blackguard's weapon of choice\". In the credits, he is listed as 'Thug'.\r\n- After buying prawn from him, he gives the 'Spread Out' `gesture`.\r\n- During combat, he uses his Iron Ball fist weapons, the `Braggart's Roar` `skill`, and consumes Boiled Prawns.\r\n##  Image Gallery\r\n ``  ``   \r\n``\r\n \r\n"

I didn't think anyone knew about this place, 'cept us jars. Oh! Are you going to be the new Potentate?*\r\nAnswering \"I'll be your Potentate.\"\r\n- *Gosh, truly? That's wonderful news! It's not easy being Potentate, though. I know, show me your hands. It's just a little test, coz, to see if you've got the right stuff. Hmm. Your skin isn't so smooth, is it... You need slick, slidey hands to be Potentate, you know. I'm sorry coz, but I don't think you've got what it takes... What a shame...*\r\nAnswering \"No, I'm not your Potentate.\"\r\n- *Oh, well, I'm sorry.*\r\nTalking again after responding \"No, I'm not your Potentate.\"\r\n- *Coz. You'll be our Potentate after all, then?*\r\nVisit\r\n- *Don't look so glum, coz. We can still chat, Potentate or not. Come back and visit me, when you can.*\r\n- *Oh, hallo again coz. I'm happy you came back. I have good tidings for you, coz. Have you noticed the rare flowers growing in this village? I asked the villagers if you could pick some of them. And they said you'd be very welcome!*\r\n- *Go on, coz, you really should pick some of our flowers. Who knows, they might be of some use.*\r\n- *Ah, hallo again. Say, coz. Have you met Uncle Alexander? He used to live here with us, but then he left, to be a champion. I asked to go with him, but he said \"The path of champions must be trod alone\". So heroic, right? I miss him though. If you see him, you should ask him to teach you how to fight, coz. He's big and tough and strong!*\r\n- *Uncle Alexander said he won't be back again. \"My home is of the past. And the past, as they say, is a different country.\" I suppose that's part of being a warrior, isn't it. So...please don't tell anyone, coz, but... I'm actually a warrior jar as well! One day, I'll be just like Uncle Alexander. And I'll have to leave the village to become a champion.*\r\n- *Ah, hallo again. Do you know what a poacher is, coz? They hunt us, smash us, and then take us away. This village is kept secret, so I think we're safe here. But you should be careful if you ever meet one of them, coz. I hope uncle Alexander beats them all up, first...*\r\nWhen found sleeping, he will sometimes say these two lines.\r\n- *”...**Uncle Alexander, look!**It’s me! I’m a warrior jar too!”*\r\n- “... *Stop, no...**Please, no, don’t break us...”*\r\n \r\nWhen Diallos arrives at Jarburg\r\n- *Oh, hello again, cos! Have you heard, a new Potentate's coming to the village! I think he said his name was Diallos. He seems a little down in the dumps, but his hands! As smooth as silk!*\r\n- *I don't know. I'm a little disappointed actually. Even though good sir Diallos has a wonderful suit of armour... He says he isn't a warrior. And since he's a coward he won't be fighting anymore. His smooth and silky hands feel nice when he pats us. But I wish we had a potentate big and strong like you.*\r\nAfter Diallos arrives at Jarburg (at night)\r\n- *... They're wonderful, Diallos. So smooth, and silky... ...*\r\nAfter coming back to Jarburg\r\n- *O-oh! Coz! I'm glad you came. But we're fine now. Diallos fought the poacher. Though quite a lot of us got broken... I won't cry though... I'm a warrior jar. A warrior. \"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood.\"  That's the kind of warrior I want to be one day, coz. Even if I'm scared, I'll still fight to protect everyone.*\r\nAfter completing Iron Fist Alexander's questline\r\n- *Thanks for coming back, coz. I've been thinking. It's time for me to set out on a journey. As a warrior jar, upon the path of champions.*\r\n- (If player chooses to 'Give Alexander's Insides') *Wow, coz, are these... Insides? From Uncle Alexander? ... Thank you, coz. I'm a warrior jar, so I need to be strong. I can really have them, right? I understand. I'll get strong. Strong enough I deserve to have Uncle's insides.*\r\n- *I don't think I'll see you again, when I set out. Warriors are supposed to work alone. Goodbye, coz. And thanks for everything. I'll never forget you, coz. *\r\nWhen attacked\r\n- *Oh? What's the matter, coz? Don't be such a nasty brute.*\r\nUpon Death\r\n- *...So, this is who you are, coz... You've cracked my heart. Please, don't crack the others...*\r\n- *So, you were a poacher, too. But the tale of house Hoslow is told in blood. I'll find you, one day, coz...*\r\n \r\n### Elden Ring Jar Bairn Notes & Trivia\r\n- You do not need to give Jar Bairn Alexander's Innards to activate the attack on Jarburg if attempting to complete Diallos's questline.\r\n- Jar Bairn will sometimes be found sleeping, and appears to either be having a nightmare about being attacked by poachers, or dreaming about becoming a Warrior Jar.\r\n \r\n \r\n"
